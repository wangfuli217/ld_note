This file contains the source code for the programs in "flex and
bison" published by O'Reilly in 2009.  If you use this code in a
project or product I would appreciate credit, and, of course, it would
be nice if you bought a copy of the book.

The Makefiles are written for the widely available GNU Make.  The
code has been tested with flex 2.5.35 and bison 2.4.1.  If you find
bugs in this code, please send e-mail (preferably with fixes) so I can
note it in errata and fix it in a future version.
