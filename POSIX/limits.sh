 2.5 limits.h

The limits header defines the characteristics of variable types.

2.5.1 Defined Values

The following values are defined with the #define directive. These values are implementation-specific, but may not be any lower than what is given here.
CHAR_BIT 8 	Number of bits in a byte.
SCHAR_MIN -127 	Minimum value for a signed char.
SCHAR_MAX +127 	Maximum value for a signed char.
UCHAR_MAX 255 	Maximum value for an unsigned char.
CHAR_MIN
CHAR_MAX 	These define the minimum and maximum values for a char. If a char is being represented as a signed integer, then their values are the same as the signed char (SCHAR) values. Otherwise CHAR_MIN is 0 and CHAR_MAX is the same as UCHAR_MAX.
MB_LEN_MAX 1 	Maximum number of bytes in a multibyte character.
SHRT_MIN -32767 	Minimum value for a short int.
SHRT_MAX +32767 	Maximum value for a short int.
USHRT_MAX 65535 	Maximum value for an unsigned short int.
INT_MIN -32767 	Minimum value for an int.
INT_MAX +32767 	Maximum value for an int.
UINT_MAX 65535 	Maximum value for an unsigned int.
LONG_MIN -2147483647 	Minimum value for a long int.
LONG_MAX +2147483647 	Maximum value for a long int.
ULONG_MAX 4294967295 	Maximum value for an unsigned long int.
