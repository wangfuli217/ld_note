使用gdb时，如果想查看gdb版权相关信息，可以使用“`show copying`”命令:  

	(gdb) show copying
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

	 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
	
	                            Preamble
	
	  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
	software and other kinds of works.
	
	  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
	to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
	the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
	share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
	software for all its use
	......

或者“`show warranty`”命令：

	(gdb) show warranty
	  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
	
	  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
	APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
	HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
	OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
	THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
	IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
	ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
	
	  16. Limitation of Liability.
	
	  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
	THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
	GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
	USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
	DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
	PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
	EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
	SUCH DAMAGES.
	
	  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
	
	  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
	above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
	reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
	an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
	Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
	copy of the Program in return for a fee.
