canfdtest: invalid option -- 'h'
Usage: canfdtest [options] <can-interface>

Options: -v       (low verbosity)
         -vv      (high verbosity)
         -g       (generate messages)
         -l COUNT (test loop count)

With the option '-g' CAN messages are generated and checked
on <can-interface>, otherwise all messages received on the
<can-interface> are sent back incrementing the CAN id and
all data bytes. The program can be aborted with ^C.

Example:
	on DUT : canfdtest -v can0
	on Host: canfdtest -g -v can2
