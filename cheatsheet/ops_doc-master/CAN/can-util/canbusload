Usage: canbusload [options] <CAN interface>+
  (use CTRL-C to terminate canbusload)

Options: -t (show current time on the first line)
         -c (colorize lines)
         -b (show bargraph in 5% resolution)
         -r (redraw the terminal - similar to top)
         -i (ignore bitstuffing in bandwidth calculation)
         -e (exact calculation of stuffed bits)

Up to 16 CAN interfaces with mandatory bitrate can be specified on the 
commandline in the form: <ifname>@<bitrate>

The bitrate is mandatory as it is needed to know the CAN bus bitrate to
calcultate the bus load percentage based on the received CAN frames.
Due to the bitstuffing estimation the calculated busload may exceed 100%.
For each given interface the data is presented in one line which contains:

(interface) (received CAN frames) (used bits total) (used bits for payload)

Example:

user$> canbusload can0@100000 can1@500000 can2@500000 can3@500000 -r -t -b -c

canbusload 2014-02-01 21:13:16 (worst case bitstuffing)
 can0@100000   805   74491  36656  74% |XXXXXXXXXXXXXX......|
 can1@500000   796   75140  37728  15% |XXX.................|
 can2@500000     0       0      0   0% |....................|
 can3@500000    47    4633   2424   0% |....................|
