canplayer: invalid option -- 'h'

Usage: canplayer <options> [interface assignment]*

Options:              -I <infile>  (default stdin)
                      -l <num>     (process input file <num> times)
                                   (Use 'i' for infinite loop - default: 1)
                      -t           (ignore timestamps: send frames immediately)
                      -g <ms>      (gap in milli seconds - default: 1 ms)
                      -s <s>       (skip gaps in timestamps > 's' seconds)
                      -x           (disable local loopback of sent CAN frames)
                      -v           (verbose: print sent CAN frames)

Interface assignment:  0..n assignments like <write-if>=<log-if>
e.g. vcan2=can0 ( send frames received from can0 on vcan2 )
extra hook: stdout=can0 ( print logfile line marked with can0 on stdout )
No assignments => send frames to the interface(s) they had been received from.

Lines in the logfile not beginning with '(' (start of timestamp) are ignored.
