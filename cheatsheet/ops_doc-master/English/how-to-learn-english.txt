## Synopsis
For me the only right way to learn a foreign language is to do it the
same way you learned your birth tongue. That is, trying to use it in your
life and work. 

## Intended Audience
I would like to talk about only the situation in China. Everybody is spending lots of
time studying, but most people are on the wrong track. That's why I feel
this HOWTO might be meaningful.

The intended audience would be people like
me who need to use English in daily work, but do not really have
much time to study it. And the people who want to explore the western
culture and already determined to be a life long English Learner. 

## About  Grammar 
I am never interested in learning grammar, it is not because I do not want to 
write sentences formally and rightly, but rather that it is too
difficult to learn. Grammar is like this, you learn one rule
and 1000 exceptions will come with it. 

Too much concern on grammar makes learning so
boring and using English so painful. 

## you do not need to learn grammar
It will come to you after you read enough right English sentences.

## What is good English?
The topic seems a little obscure, I know that. Here I only focus on
Chinese English learners, for whom English is a foreign language. I
want to start by giving my believe that it is basically impossible to
learn perfect English without staying in a English-speaking country
for more than 10 years. 

Here the word "perfect" means "not obviously different
from native speakers". No body speaks a language perfectly, many native
speaker speak very bad grammar, which makes their better educated
fellow citizen angry since they taint the language of Shakespeare, and
make me happy, since I can do better:-) However, even these guys
speaks better English than that of a Chinese English
Professor. Because by my definition, having good English means you can
wrap your mind easily to express your emotion clearly and telling
things clearly. Language is just a tool, a good tool shall be
something with which you can create things neither useful or
beautiful efficiently. As to grammars and other superficial stuff, I
beg to say they are only secondary. And that is one of the main
reasons I stick to the point that 

## English can only be learned in practical use.     
Well, I actually started to study this language in 1995, the first
year of my junior middle school. But it was in the year of 2008 that I
started to really using it. 


I want to tell you why I did such a switch since I believe many people has such kind of dilemma as well.

I started programming since the first year of my post graduate study. It was
not so bad, coding was also interesting. But one year later, that was the
winter of 2007, I felt I had been kept really busy for programming and I did
not have enough time for English study.

I was scared, since if you do not have enough for English, you start to forget
things. I thought I might lost all I had achieved till then. So it was kind of
life or death moment for my English Learning. So I made 
## A big decision

I throwed away all my programming books in Chinese, and uninstalled Chinese input
on my PC. That was a pretty crazy action I took, a big leap of faith, but it
turned out to be really rewarding for my life and career. Until now, I still
do not have Chinese input on my computer:)

## Trap to avoid
In all my six years middle school life, everybody in my class tried
really hard to learn English. But I really hated it, English study is so boring

I think that is because:

## Examinations are Evil

It is worse than bad, it is evil. The more attention you put into exams, the less likely you can speak English well.

## conclusion

Forget about exams, try to use English as often as you can.
