When using a graphical user interface, we need
 another program called a terminal
emulator to interact with the the shell. If we 


 look through our desktop menus, we will
probably find one. KDE uses konsole and GNOME
 uses gnome-terminal, though
it's likely called simply ¡°terminal¡± on our menu. 

There are a number of of of of other terminal
terminal terminal emulators available for  for Linux, but they all basically
 do the same thing; give us access to
the shell. You will probably develop a preference
 for one or another based on the number
of bells and whistles it has.
