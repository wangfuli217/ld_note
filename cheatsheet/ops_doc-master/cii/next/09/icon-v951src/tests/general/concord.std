     1  Order, Coleoptera, (Beetles). Many beetles are colored so as
     2  to resemble the surfaces which they habitually frequent, and they thus
     3  escape detection by their enemies. Other species, for instance, diamond-beetles, are ornamented
     4  with splendid colors, which are often arranged in stripes, spots, crosses,
     5  and other elegant patterns.  Such colors can hardly serve directly as a protection, except in the case
     6  of certain flower-feeding species; but they may serve as a warning or means of
     7  recognition, on the same principle as the
     8  phosphorescence of the glow-worm.
     9  As with beetles the colors of the two sexes are generally alike, we have
    10  no evidence that they have been gained through sexual selection; but this is
    11  at least possible, for they may have been developed in one sex and then
    12  transferred to the other; and this view is even in some degree probable
    13  in those groups which possess other well-marked secondary
    14  sexual characters. Blind beetles, which cannot, of course, behold each
    15  other's beauty, never, as I hear from Mr. Waterhouse, Jr., exhibit bright
    16  colors, though they often have polished coats; but the explanation of their
    17  obscurity may be that they generally inhabit caves and other obscure stations.
