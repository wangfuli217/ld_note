System configuration:

	32-bit variant configuration for Intel-based Apple Macintosh.

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.5.1

Installer:

	Gregg Townsend
	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	None

Known bugs:

	None

Comments:
	
	This configuration forces a 32-bit build of Icon on a 64-bit
	Intel-based Macintosh computer.  This is normally not needed and
	the standard "macintosh" configuration should be used instead.

	Tested with MacOS 10.6.2 (Snow Leopard),
	using Xcode 3.2.1 and GCC 4.2.1.
