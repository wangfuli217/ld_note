Installer:

	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona
	(with thanks to Chris Tenaglia)

	Dynamic loading (loadfunc)

Comments:

	Tested on an RX2600 server (Itanium architecture) running
	HP-UX version B.11.23.  Will probably also work on PA-RISC.

	HP/UX uses the LPATH environment variable as a path to the linker.
	This conflicts with Icon's use of LPATH to search for $include files.
