Comments:

	Tested on x86 FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE #0 using cc (GCC) 4.2.1.
	Tested on x86 OpenBSD 5.3 using cc (GCC) 4.2.1

	This configuration is for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
	For Darwin (Apple Macintosh), use the "macintosh" configuration.

	Building on OpenBSD produces unsuppressible linker warnings
	that urge the replacement of certain standard library functions
	with nonstandard ones.  This has not been done.
