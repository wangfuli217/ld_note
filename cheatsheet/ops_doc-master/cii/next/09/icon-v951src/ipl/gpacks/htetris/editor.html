<h2>The brick editor</h2><br>
<font size="5">
<b>htetris</b> includes a brick editor where the user can create his/hers own
bricks and include them when playing the game.
A brick consists of squares, or tiles, which is the basic unit of measurement
for a brick. A brick must be at least one square and at most ten by ten squares
in size. Any rectangular format in between is allowed.<br>
The editor interface consists of an area where bricks are edited, a menu bar
with three menus and two buttons as shown below.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
To fill a square on the edit pane, the user points the mouse at that square
and clicks the left mouse button. The right mouse button is used to erase
a filled square. Only one color per brick can be used.<br>
The upper left corner of the currently edited brick resides in the upper left
corner of the edit pane. It is not possible to fill a square outside the
bounds of the current brick. There is a grid which shows the bounds when it
is shown. The grid can be switched on and off by pressing the
<b>Toggle grid</b> button on the interface. The <b>Clear</b> button clears
whatever filled squares there are but does not affect the grid.
A brick can take on any shape, even unconnected regions in the same brick.<br>
A brick can be saved to file and previously saved bricks can be opened and
re-edited. All features are described in detail below.

<h2>Menu items and features</h2><br>
<font size="5">
<ul type="square">
<li>The <b>File</b> menu<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>New</b><br>
Lets the user start editing a new brick of the chosen size and color.
A brick must be at least one by one and at most ten by ten in size.<br>
Valid colors are: yellow, red, blue, green, orange, magenta, cyan and brown.<br>
When the user clicks <b>Okay</b> in the dialog box, an empty grid of the given
size shows up on the edit pane.
<li><b>Open</b><br>
If <b>Open</b> is selected, a dialog appears which prompts the user for the
filename of a previously saved brick. Brick files always have the extension
<b>.brk</b> but this is not necessary to include, although it is perfectly
alright to do so.<br>
If the file is valid and could be opened successfully, the editor resets itself
to the measurements and color of the loaded brick and the brick appears with
the grid on.
<li><b>Save</b><br>
The user enters a filename in the shown dialog box and the brick is saved
under that name. If the extension <b>.brk</b> is not added to the name, the
editor automaticly adds it before saving. If the user enter a name with
characters after <b>.brk</b>, those are discarded. Saving can not be performed
if there are no filled squares. If not all rows and columns are used for the
brick to be saved, the brick is stripped of such empty rows and columns before
it is saved. This does not apply to empty rows and columns between filled
squares, only "edge" rows and columns are stripped off.
<li><b>Quit</b><br>
This closes the brick editor and returns focus to the htetris application.
</ul>
<br>
<li>The <b>Brick</b> menu<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Change color</b><br>
This changes the color of the currently edited brick in place. From now on,
this color is used to fill squares unless color is changed again, a brick is
loaded from file or a new brick is started.<br>
The same colors as mentioned above under <b>New</b> are valid.
</ul>
<br>
<li>The <b>Help</b> menu<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>How to edit</b><br>
This option basicly displays the same information as the first section of this
document.
<li><b>Menus</b><br>
This option basicly displays the same information as the this section of this
document.
