<h2>The interface</h2><br>
<font size="5">
The graphical user interface of this application has several parts.
These include:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>The game playing area.<br>
This is the rectangular area to the far right on the interface. This is
where the bricks fall and the action resides during a game.
<li>The next brick display.<br>
During a game, the next brick to come up is showed here. That way the player
has an opportunity of planning ahead one step.
<li>Convenience buttons.<br>
These are the four functions that are applicable when a game is in progress.
They are also availible in the <b>Game</b> menu and as keyboard shortcuts.
<li>Level of difficulty display.<br>
This shows the current level if a game is in progress. If a game is not in
progress it shows the most recently played level or, if the <b>Pick level</b>
option described in <a href="http://lww.CS.Arizona.EDU:80/~henriks/menus.html"><b>Menu items and features</b></a>.
has been used, the level at which the next game will start.
<li>Current score display.<br>
This shows the current score if a game is in progress. If a game is not in
progress it shows the final score of the most recently played game.
<li>Highscore display.<br>
If the application is ran for the first time from the current directory or
if the file <b>highscore.dat</b> has been deleted, the initial highscore is
zero. Otherwise, the highscore is read from the above mentioned file. If a
game results in a score higher than the current highscore, the highscore
display is updated and the new highscore is saved to file. This does not
happen if a game is stopped, a new game is started or the application is
closed when a game is in progress.
<li>The menu bar.<br>
There are five menus on the menu bar, each of which holds a category of
options and features. The menus are named after the category they contain.
Each menu and its different menu items are described in detail in
<a href="http://lww.CS.Arizona.EDU:80/~henriks/menus.html"><b>Menu items and features</b></a>.
<li>Initial animation area.<br>
When the <b>htetris</b> application is started, an animation of bricks is
performed here. This is just for show and has no other function.
</ol>
