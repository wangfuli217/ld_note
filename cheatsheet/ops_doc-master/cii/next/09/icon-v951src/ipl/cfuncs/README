C Interface Functions for Icon

This directory contains C functions that can be called from Icon on
systems supporting dynamic loading via dlopen(3).  These systems include
SunOS, Solaris, OSF/1, Irix, and Linux.

To see what's available, look at the comments in the .c files.  To use
a C function, just use "link cfunc" and call the function by name.

The C functions are loaded at runtime from a library file "libcfunc.so",
which is found automatically in the Icon binary directory.  This can be
be overridden by setting the FPATH environment variable to a search path.

To build the library, run "make".  This process also builds "cfunc.icn",
the file of interface procedures that actually load the C functions.
