This directory contains some demonstrations of loadfunc().
Some more generally useful C functions are provided in the ipl/cfuncs
directory, and some of these test drivers depend on them.

Set IPATH and FPATH, then type "make" to build everything.

The C functions are as follows:
    argdump	print arguments on standard output
    cspgen	cellular automata ager for "cspace" (below)
    ddump	dump descriptor in hexadecimal

The Icon programs are as follows:
    btest	simple demo using bitcount() from cfuncs library
    cspace	cellular automata demonstration; opens a graphics window
    ddtest	simple demo using ddump()
    dldemo	simple demo using argdump()
    newsgrp	connect to news server and print subjects from a newsgroup
    tnet	very simple telnet client

Further information is contained in the comments in the individual files.
