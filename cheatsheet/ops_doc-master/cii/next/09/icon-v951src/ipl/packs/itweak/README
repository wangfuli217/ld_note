WHAT IS ITWEAK?

'itweak' is an interactive debugging utility for the Icon programming
language. The idea is that you compile your Icon program to ucode
files (.u1, .u2). 'itweak' then tweaks the ucode, inserting potential
breakpoints. The resulting ucode files are linked with a debugging
run-time and off you go. The 'itweak' system provides you with most of
the facilities you would expect from an interactive debugger,
including the ability to evaluate a wide range of Icon expressions.

PREREQUISITES

'itweak' requires Icon 8.10 or higher. It is completely written in
Icon, and thus as portable as Icon itself.

INSTANT ITWEAK -- UNIX

Assuming you have the itweak distribution in the form of a file named
'itweak-<version>.tar.gz' (where <version> is a version designator):
uncompress and untar the file. This can be done in a single step,

	gunzip < itweak-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create an installation directory in the current directory.
The name of the installation directory will be 'itweak-<version>'.

To install itweak, type 'make' in the installation directory. Run a
demo session by typing 'make demo'.

OTHER SYSTEMS -- NOT SO INSTANT

For systems other than Unix, and for more information, please refer to
the documentation.
