Dependencies:

The utilities contained within are, for the most part, dependency free.  Some 
have dependencies that are typically non-issues -- things like zlib and 
libpcap.  The only uncommon, but extremely useful dependency is on Niels 
Provos' libevent package.  We use it to create an event driven framework for 
certain tools -- telson, as an example.

libevent is available at:
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

It should work with any version. 


Your OS probably has these already, but if you feel compelled to download them 
on your own, or for some reason, those available on your system aren't working,
the following may come in handy.

libpcap is available at:
http://www.tcpdump.org/

Its been tested with 0.8.x and 0.9.x.

zlib is available at:
http://www.zlib.net


Compilation:

We're simple Makefile people.  No configuration scripts -- at least, not yet.

To compile, simply type:
$ make

To install:
$ make install

If you have libevent in an odd place, that your compiler won't find, or you 
don't want to install it, you can do the following:
$ LFLAGS=-L../libevent-1.1a/.libs IFLAGS=-I../libevent-1.1a/ make

Thus altering the environment during compilation.  The above works if you have 
libevent installed one directory level down.  Adjust as needed for your 
environment.

You can also alter common.mk to change the settings.  That works too.
