/**
 * A <b>Process</b> represent an operating system process. A new Process 
 * object is created via Command_execute(). 
 * 
 * The sub-process represented by this Process does not have its own terminal 
 * or console. All its standard I/O (i.e. stdin, stdout, stderr) operations 
 * will be redirected to the parent process where they can be accessed using 
 * the streams obtained using the methods Process_getOutputStream(), 
 * Process_getInputStream(), and Process_getErrorStream(). Your program can 
 * then use these streams to feed input to and get output from the sub-process.
 * 
 * The sub-process continues executing until it stops or until either 
 * Process_free() is called or it is terminated with either Process_terminate()
 * or Process_kill().
 *
 * <h4>Environment</h4>
 * The Process inherits the environment from the calling process. Clients can
 * also call Command_setEnv() to set or reset environment variables as needed
 * <em>before</em> calling Command_execute(). Environment variables set this way
 * will be added to the sub-process at execution time.
