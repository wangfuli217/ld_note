1. linear
1.1 /etc/pointercal
The format of pointer cal is as follows,
xscale xymix xoffset yxmix yscale yoffset scaler

    After these seven numbers, I have a null and two other values which I don't know what they do. 
The pointercal is only used for module linear (/etc/ts.conf). You can see the source here,

https://github.com/libts/tslib/blob/a362845b3ca6d32ff1fe1dec333606916c71cfde/plugins/linear.c

Here is another formula without array values,
Xs -> x screen value, Xt -> x touch value, Ys, Yt similar.

Xs = (Xt*xscale + Yt*xymix + xoffset)/scaler
Ys = (Xt*yxmix + Yt*yscale + yoffset)/scaler

    This is an affine transform (or subset as the 'Xt*Yt' is not used). If your touch is capacitive it may be quite linear. 
Resistive touch screens usually need individual calibration, may drift over time/temperature and are likely to need 
re-calibration at some point.
