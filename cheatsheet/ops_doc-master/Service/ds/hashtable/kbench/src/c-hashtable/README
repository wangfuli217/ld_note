The following sources files were locally copied from a git mirror by David A Roberts available at:
  http://github.com/davidar/c-hashtable

  - hashtable.h
  - hashtable.c
  - hashtable_private.h


No modification was needed to compile the files as a standalone module.

The following modification was needed to fix a bug:
  - hashtable.c  =>  don't free the key that was not malloced in the library during entry setup
