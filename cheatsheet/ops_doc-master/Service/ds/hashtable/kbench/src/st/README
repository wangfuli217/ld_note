The following sources files were copied from a github copy included in hash_benchmark project by Andre' Medeiros available at:
  http://github.com/andremedeiros/hash_benchmark

  - st.h
  - st.c

No modification was needed to compile the files as a standalone module.


The other 2 files in this directory:
  ORG-st.h
  ORG-st.c
were downloaded from http://opensource.apple.com/source/ruby/ruby-4/ruby/st.[hc]?txt
and they should be by the original files without Ruby's modifications.
