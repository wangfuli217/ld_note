The following sources files were locally copied from latest git version:
  - htable.h
  - htable.c
  - hash.h
  - hash.c

The following modifications were needed to compile the files as a standalone module:
  1. config.h was locally edited to define symbols required by htable.h
     (only COLD is really mandatory and must be defined in config.h)
  2. htable.c was modified in order to avoid dependency from compiler.h
  3. hash.h was modified in order to avoid dependency from build_assert.h
