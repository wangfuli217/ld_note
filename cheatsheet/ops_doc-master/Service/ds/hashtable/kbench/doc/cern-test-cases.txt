Test cases described in:
========================
https://gitlab.cern.ch/dss/map-benchmarks

SET            - Adds a random key/value-pair to the hashtable. Note that the key may already exist in the hashtable
GET            - Retrieves a random value from the hashtable, using a (randomly selected) key that is already in the hashtable
GET_RANDOM     - Retrieves a randomly generated key from the hashtable. Chances are this key does not exist
DELETE         - Like get, but delete the key
DELETE_RANDOM  - Like get-random, but delete the key
ITERATE        - Iterates over all entries in the hashtable (in arbitrary order)
