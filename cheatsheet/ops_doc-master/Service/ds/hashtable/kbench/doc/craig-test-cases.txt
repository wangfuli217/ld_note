Test case implemented in Google sparse hash (time_hash_map.cc)
==============================================================

map_grow:             add N elements to the hash map
map_predict/grow:     reserve space first, then add elements
map_replace:          add elements, overwrite their values in another loop
map_fetch_random:     fetch all elements one-by-one (indexing by random key), N elements in map
map_fetch_sequential: fetch all elements one-by-one (indexing by key), N elements in map
map_fetch_empty:      same, on empty map
map_remove:           remove all elements from map, one by one, N elements in map
map_toggle:           in every iteration add element, then erase it immediately
map_iterate:          iterate over all the hash map
