# intrusive-ds

## About

A collection of intrusive data-structures for C

## Motivation

Intrusive data structures are much better for cache locality, utilize less
allocations and allow for various optimizations like removing an object from a
doubly-linked list in constant time.

## Supported Data Structures

* Doubly-linked list
* AVL tree
* Red-black tree
* Hash table
