 *
 * Assume the control file was changed and a new service (B) was added
 * so the monitrc file now contains the services: A B and C. The
 * running monit daemon only knows the services A and C. Upon restart
 * after a crash the monit daemon first read the monitrc file and
 * creates the service list structure with A B and C. We then read the
 * state file and update the service A and C since they are found in
 * the state file, B is not found in this file and therefore not
 * changed.
 *
 * The same strategy is used if a service was removed, e.g. if the
 * service A was removed from monitrc; when reading the state file,
 * service A is not found in the current service list (the list is
 * always generated from monitrc) and therefore A is simply discarded.
