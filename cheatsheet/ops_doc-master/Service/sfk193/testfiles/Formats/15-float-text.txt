For find (grep) behaviour tests, there is now a pure LF-based section:

The result of leveraging enormous amounts of vapourware within the scope01 of the 1st02
quarter03 should04 lead05 to an immense06 return07 on investment08 inside09 the
global10 enterprise11 whatever12. Concerning the shareholder value returning on
investments it is essential that no only those who have related to, now i forgot how
the sentence was starting.

Finally, a mix: a long line soft-wrapping around column 80, but ending with LF.

The result of leveraging enormous amounts of vapourware with the scope011 of the 1st021 quarter031 should041 lead051 to an immense061 return071 on investment081.
