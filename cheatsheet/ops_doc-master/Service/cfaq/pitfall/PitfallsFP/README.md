Catastrophic Cancellation: The Pitfalls of Floating Point Arithmetic
====================================================================

Slides and examples for a talk given at QCon London 2014, 5th March.

These examples have been developed and tested on 64-bit Linux with
GCC 4.8.1 and Python 2.7.3. Most examples should work on other systems,
perhaps with the exception of the examples using feenableexcept().
