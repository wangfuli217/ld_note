NAME
       retrieve -- get object from file

SYNOPSIS
       void * retrieve (FILE * fp)

DESCRIPTION
       retrieve() returns an object read in from the input stream
       represented by fp.  At end of file or in case of an error,
       retrieve() returns a null pointer.

       retrieve()  requires  a  sorted  table  of  class function
       pointers that can be produced  with  munch(1).   Once  the
       class description has been located, retrieve() applies the
       method geto to an area obtained with allocate.
