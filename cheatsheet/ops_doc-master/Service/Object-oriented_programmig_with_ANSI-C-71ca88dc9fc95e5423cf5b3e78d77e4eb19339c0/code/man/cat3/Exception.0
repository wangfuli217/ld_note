NAME
       Class   Exception:  Object  -- manage a stack of exception
       handlers

SYNOPSIS
       Object
           Exception
       new(Exception());
       int catch (self)
       void cause (int number)

DESCRIPTION
       Exception is a class for managing  a  stack  of  exception
       handlers.  After it is armed with catch, the newest Excep-
       tion object can receive a nonzero  exception  number  sent
       with cause().

       ctor  pushes  the  new  Exception  object  onto the global
       exception stack, dtor removes it.   These  calls  must  be
       balanced.

       catch  arms  its object for receiving an exception number.
       Once the number is sent, catch will return it.  This func-
       tion  is implemented as a macro with setjmp(3) and is sub-
       ject to the same restrictions; in particular, the function
       containing the call to catch must still be active when the
       exception number is sent.

       Other methods should generally not be applied to an Excep-
       tion object.
