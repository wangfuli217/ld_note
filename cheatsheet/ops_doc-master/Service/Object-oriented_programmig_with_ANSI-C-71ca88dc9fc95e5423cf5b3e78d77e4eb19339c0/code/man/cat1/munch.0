NAME
       munch -- produce class list

SYNOPSIS
       nm -p object... archive...  | munch

DESCRIPTION
       munch  reads  a Berkeley-style nm(1) listing from standard
       input and produces as standard  output  a  C  source  file
       defining  a  null-terminated array classes[] with pointers
       to the class functions found in each object  and  archive.
       The array is sorted by class function names.

       A class function is any name that appears with type T and,
       preceded with an underscore, with type b, d, or s.

BUGS
       This is a hack to simplify retrieval programs.   The  com-
       patible effect of option -p in Berkeley and System V nm is
       quite a surprise.

       Because HP/UX nm does not output static symbols, munch  is
       not very useful on this system.
