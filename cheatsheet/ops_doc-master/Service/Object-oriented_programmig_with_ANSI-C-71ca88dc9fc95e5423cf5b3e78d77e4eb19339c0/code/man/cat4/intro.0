DESCRIPTION
       Object(3)  is  the root class.  Object needs to be renamed
       as Objct because the original name is used by X11.

       Event(4) is a class to represent input data  such  as  key
       presses or mouse clicks.

       Ic(4)  is  the  base  class  to represent objects that can
       receive, process, and send events.  Button converts incom-
       ing events to events with definite text values.  Calc pro-
       cesses texts and sends a result on.  LineOut  displays  an
       incoming text.  Mux tries to send an incoming event to one
       of several objects.

       Crt(4) is a class to work with the curses terminal  screen
       function  package.   It sends position events for a cursor
       and text events for other key presses.  CButton implements
       Button on a curses screen.  CLineOut implements LineOut.

       List  manages  a list of objects and is taken from chapter
       7.

       Xt(4) is a class to work with the  X  Toolkit.   The  sub-
       classes  wrap  toolkit and Athena widgets.  XButton imple-
       ments a Button with a Command widget.  XLineOut implements
       a LineOut with a Label widget.
