DESCRIPTION
       A Crt object wraps a curses(3) window.  curses is initial-
       ized when the first Crt object is created.

       Crt_gate() is the event loop: it monitors the keyboard; it
       implements  a  vi-style cursor move for the keys hjkl, and
       possibly, for the arrow keys; if  return  is  pressed,  it
       sends an Event object with kind 1 and an array with column
       and row position; if control-D is  pressed,  gate  returns
       reject; any other key is sent on as an Event object with a
       string containing the key character.

       A CLineOut object implements a LineOut object on a  curses
       screen.  Incoming strings should not exceed len bytes.

       A  CButton  object  implements a Button object on a curses
       screen.  If it receives a  matching  text,  it  sends  it.
       Additionally,  if it receives a position event, e.g., from
       a Crt object, and if the coordinates are within  its  win-
       dow, it sends its text on.
