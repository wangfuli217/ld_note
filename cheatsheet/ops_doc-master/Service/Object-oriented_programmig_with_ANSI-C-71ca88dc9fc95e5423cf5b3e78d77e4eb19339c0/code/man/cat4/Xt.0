DESCRIPTION
       An  Xt object wraps a widget from the X toolkit.  makeWid-
       get() is used to create and  install  the  widget  in  the
       hierarchy;  it  takes a parent Xt object and a widget name
       from the  argument  list  pointer  to  which  app  points.
       addAllAccelerators()  is  used to install the accelerators
       below the Xt object.  setLabel() sets the label  resource.
       addCallback()  adds  a  callback  function to the callback
       list.

       An XtApplicationShell object wraps  an  application  shell
       widget  from the X toolkit.  When it is created, the shell
       widget is also created and X toolkit options  are  removed
       from  the main program argument list passed to new().  The
       application main loop is mainLoop().

       XawBox, XawCommand, XawForm, and XawLabel objects wrap the
       corresponding  Athena widgets.  When they are created, the
       widgets are also created.  setLabel() is accepted by  Xaw-
       Command  and  XawLabel.  A callback function can be regis-
       tered with an XawCommand object by addCallback().

       An XButton object is a Button object implemented  with  an
       XawCommand  object.   It  forwards  wire() to its internal
       Button object and it sets a callback  to  gate()  to  this
       button  so  that  it sends its text on if notify() is exe-
       cuted, i.e., if the button is clicked.   Accelerators  can

       be used to arrange for other calls to notify().

       An XLineOut object is a LineOut object implemented with an
       XawLabel object.  It forwards gate() to itself to  receive
       and  display a string.  If permitted by the parent widget,
       its widget will change its size according to the string.
