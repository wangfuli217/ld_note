This directory contains functions that are missing on the Windows platform.  In
particular, mmap, munmap, and msync are not available on Windows. These
replacements are used on both Cygwin and MinGW. (On Cygwin the built-in mmap
has no write support, and is not used).

mmap.c
mman.h

Special thanks to Horea Haitonic for contributing mmap.c and mman.h.
