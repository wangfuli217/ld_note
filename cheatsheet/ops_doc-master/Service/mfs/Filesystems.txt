mcachefs

Author: Michael Still / mikal at stillhq com

Homepage: http://lists.samba.org/archive/linux/2004-March/010211.html

Description mcachefs is a simple caching filesystem for Linux using FUSE. It works by copying the file that you asked for when the file is opened, and then using that copy for all subsequent requests for the file. This is really a fairly naive approach to caching, and will be improved in the future.

Description A FUSE based automounter.

fuse_adfs

Author: David Boddie / david at boddie org uk

Homepage: http://www.boddie.org.uk/david/Projects/Python/FUSE/

fsfipi & vaves

Author: Václav Jůza / vaclavjuza at gmail dot com

Homepage: http://fsfipi.sourceforge.net (not yet finished), download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/fsfipi

Description fsfipi: A framework supporting a cascade of filters, which modify the behaviour of a filesystem. Each filter uses the same interface for the higher level (i. e. the requests, what operations this filesystem shall do) and for the lower level interface (performing the file operations). Only the lowest level filter uses actual system calls to store files on the real file system (localfs) or there is a possibility of making sshfs-like lowest level filter. The only highest level filter now is fuse_interface, which implements a fuse filesystem daemon and sends the requests to the lower level filter.

vaves: a filter for this framework, implementing a very configurable versioning file system.

hierfs

Author: Georges Kesseler

Homepage: http://hierfs.sourceforge.net/

Description a simple way of managing a vast amount of data over multiple CD-R media by simulating all files on the CDs as if they were online on the harddisk. When a file is accessed, a dialog box asks for the correct CD. So any program can be used to acces the data without needing to know the files are on CD. Scripts are included for migrating data to CD (which was the more difficult work). Note that this project has not been updated since 3 years.

OutOfOrderFS

Homepage: https://github.com/vi/outoforderfs

Author: Vitaly "_Vi" Shukela

Description: For testing. Single-file "block" filesystem that filters writes to your device. Each write is delayed by random amount of time. Although user of the file does not see it, interrupting OutOfOrderFS throws away some recently written blocks (not preserving order, obviously), intentionally breaking abstraction. Old blocks will remain instead of some random recently written blocks. It is designed to emulate inconsistent removal of storage without proper flushing and test how well are filesystems and databases proofed against it.
