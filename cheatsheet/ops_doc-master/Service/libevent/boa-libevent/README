Boa-libevent is a modified version of boa.
It is based on boa-0.94.13.
I replace select with libevent. So libevent is needed.

Boa is the first server I study, and libevent is the first event lib I know.
This program is just for fun!

I modified boa.c，select.c，signal.c，global.h，boa.h and added new event.c.
The origin README remains as README.boa.
Others remain the same.

More introduction about this program can be found at:
