 Installation
 ============

Before to attempt to compile 'lb' you need to have the sources of the
Libevent-2.x series on your system and build it from sources by yourself.
Because I am experimenting with features available only with libevent-2.x series
and it is not already packaged on most distributions a local copy must
be available on the same system you are trying 'lb'.

The libevent-2.x tarball can be downloaded for example from:
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent-2.0.1-alpha.tar.gz
or on their public subversion repository.

Starting at version 0.2.1 'lb' uses the standard GNU Build System,
so in order to compile 'lb' to have to issue the so usual commands:

you@office 1> ./configure --with-libevent=<your libevent-2.x development tree>
you@office 2> ./make


The following steps are provided as just an example about how to compile 'lb'.

Checkout latest Libevent svn revision from SourceForge and download latest
'lb' version from:
http://lb.tecsiel.it/Download

  1> mkdir somedir
  2> cd somedir
  3> svn co https://levent.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/levent/trunk/libevent libevent
  4> wget http://lb.tecsiel.it/Download.lb-x.y.z.tar.gz
  5> cd libevent
  6> tar xvfz ../lb-x.y.z.tar.gz
  7> cd lb-x.y.z
  8> ./configure --with-libevent=../
  9> make

  This will create the binary programs:
   o 'lb' that is the benchmark tool itself (a HTTP client)
   o 'wsl' that is a minimal web server (use it as the test for 'lb')
   o 'nb' is another very fast HTTP client (stolen from the libevent-2.x sources and modified)

The shell script 'bench-lb.sh', also included in the tarball, allows you
to benchmark the benchmarking tools and compare how fast they are.
