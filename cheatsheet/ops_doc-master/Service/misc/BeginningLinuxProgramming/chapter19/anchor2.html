<P>
<H2>This is anchor2.html</H2>
Here is a simple document. It contains an anchor that allows you to jump to
the <A HREF="anchor1.html#bottom"> bottom 
of anchor1.html</A> if you wish.
<P> We need to insert some text.</P>
<P> Quite a lot of text.</P>
<P> If we didn't, how could you tell which was <B>top</B> and which was
<B>bottom</B> of this document?</P>
<P> You can also <A HREF="#top"> jump to the top</A> of this document if you
wish</P>
<P> It might well all appear all on the same page.</P>
<P> Soon we will have enough text.</P>
<P> To prevent this fitting </P>
<P> on</P>
<P> a</P>
<P> single</P>
<P> page!</P>
<P> This is the bottom, but you can jump to the <A NAME="bottom"
HREF="#top">top</A> if you want, or back to <A HREF="anchor1.html">
anchor1.html</A> if you prefer!</P>
