<H2>This is anchor3.html</H2>
Here is a simple document. It contains an anchor that allows you to jump by
clicking on a picture. Actually the HREF file "beer.html" doesn't exist,
but the browser does not discover this unless you click to take the hyper link.
<P> You can also <A HREF="http://apache.wrox.co.uk/projsp/caption.shtml"><IMG SRC="black.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
ALT="jump to beer.html"></A> use images as
clickable items if you wish.</P>

<P> The end.</P>
