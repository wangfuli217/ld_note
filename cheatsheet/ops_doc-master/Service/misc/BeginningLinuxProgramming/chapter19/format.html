<H2>This is file format.html</H2>
<P>
And here is some ordinary text.
<!- And here we have inserted a comment ->
<!- which takes two lines to type in ->
</P>
<H4>Heading level four</H4>
looks like the above.
<H5 ALIGN="center">This is a centered level five</H5>
heading, showing the extra ALIGN tag.
<P>
we can do quite a lot of typing, then put a break in here,<BR>so the text flow is broken up.
</P><P>
If we didn't use the BR tag then text would just keep on flowing across the page. If the user changes the width of the browser window then the text adjusts accordingly.
<HR>
Used sparingly a horizontal rule is a good separator.
</P><P>
Let us try some other changes. Here is some <B>bold</B> text, some <I>Italicized</I> text and some <EM>emphasized</EM> text. A fixed width font is selected with TT like <TT>this section</TT> of text. 
</P><P>
If we would like to
include some code we can make it look like this:<BR>
<CODE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<BR>
int main() {<BR>

printf("Hello World\n");<BR>
}<BR>
</CODE>
</P><P>
Perhaps an easier way is to use the PRE
tag, like this:<BR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
printf("Hello World\n");
}
</PRE>
</P><P>
Here is an example of an address:<BR>
<ADDRESS>
Mr. Postman Pat<BR>
7 Posty Lane,<BR>
Greendale<BR>
Lancashire<BR>
Great Britain<BR>
</ADDRESS>
</P><P>
This is a block quotation from<BR>
<CITE>Macbeth, by William Shakespeare</CITE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come,
let me clutch thee:<BR>
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P><P>
Which I consider an outstandingly good play.
