# Move all realtime (RT) tasks in the cgroups version 2 unified hierarchy
# to the cgroup root directory. This can be useful because it is not
# possible to enable the "cpu" controller if there are RT tasks in nonroot
# cgroups.  This restriction is in place because the cgroups v2 "cpu"
# controller does not yet understand how to handle RT tasks.
#
# This script must be run as superuser.
#
# The script by default assumes that the cgroup v2 hierarchy
# is mounted at /sys/fs/cgroup/unified. If the hierarchy is 
# mounted elswhere, then that location should be specified as
# the (sole) command-line argument to the script.
