This file contains information about compiling the programs from Chapter 22
of UNIX Systems Programming.

Under Solaris: no changes needed.

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

Under Mac OS X:
   Mac OS X does not support the ftw function which is used in the only
   program in this chapter.
   Run the convertmac program to eliminate all programs from the default
   compilation in makefile.

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
