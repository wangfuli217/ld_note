This file contains information about compiling the programs from Chapter 13
of UNIX Systems Programming.

Under Solaris: no changes needed.

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

   Also, Linux has a strerror_r in the standard library that conflicts with
   the one defined in this chapter.  The convertlinux program removes
   strerrortest from the programs that are compiled by default.

Under Mac OS X:
   Mac OS X does not need to have the rt library explicitly included on the
   compile line.  Run the convertmac program once to modify the makeilfe
   to remove this.

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
