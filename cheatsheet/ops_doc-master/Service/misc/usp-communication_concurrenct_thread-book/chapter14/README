This file contains information about compiling the programs from Chapter 14
of UNIX Systems Programming.

Under Solaris: no changes needed.

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

   Also, Linux does not have named semaphores.  Although the named semaphore
   programs compile, running them produces an error: Function not implemented.
   The convertlinux program removes the two programs that use named semaphores
   from the programs that are compiled by default.

Under Mac OS X:
   Mac OS X does not need to have the rt library explicitly included on the
   compile line.  Run the convertmac program once to modify the makeilfe
   to remove this.

   Also, Mac OS X, defines SEM_FAILED in sys/semaphore.h as an int.
   It really should be a pointer so convertmac redefines this constant
   in getnamed to make it a pointer.  A warning message indicating that
   SEM_FAILED is being redefined is displayed when getnamed is compiled.

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
