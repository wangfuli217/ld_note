This file contains information about compiling the programs from Appendix C
of UNIX Systems Programming.

Under Solaris: no changes needed.

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

   Also, Linux does not need the -lsocket library.  The convertlinux program
   removes this from makefile.

   Lastly, linux does not support gethostbyname_r and gethostbyaddr_r as
   described in the text so the convertlinux program removes these
   implementations from the default compilation.

Under Mac OS X:
   Mac OS X does not need either of the libraries -lsocket or -lnsl.
   Run the convertmac program once to remove these from the makefile.

   Also, Max OS X does not support gethostbyname_r and gethostbyaddr_r
   so the convertlinux program removes these implementations from the 
   default compilation.

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
