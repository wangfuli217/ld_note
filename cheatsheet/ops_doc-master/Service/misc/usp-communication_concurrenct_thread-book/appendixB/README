This file contains information about compiling the programs from Appendix B
of UNIX Systems Programming.

This chapter contains the restart library that is used in other chapters.

There is nothing to compile here.

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
