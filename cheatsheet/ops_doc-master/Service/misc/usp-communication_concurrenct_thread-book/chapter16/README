This file contains information about compiling the programs from Chapter 16
of UNIX Systems Programming.

Under Solaris: no changes needed.

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

Under Mac OS X:
   Mac OS X does not need to have the rt library explicitly included on the
   compile line.  Run the convertmac program once to modify the makeilfe
   to remove this.

   The dirent.h include file needs the stdlib.h include file.
   The convertmac program also modifies isregulartest.c to
   include stdlib.h before dirent.h:

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
