This file contains information about compiling the programs from Chapter 6
of UNIX Systems Programming.

The audio programs are not compiled by default, since audio is system
dependent.

Under Solaris:
   To compile the audio programs, execute
      make audio

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

Under Mac OS X: no changes needed.

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
