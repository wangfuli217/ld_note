This file contains information about compiling the programs from Chapter 5
of UNIX Systems Programming.

Under Solaris: no changes needed.

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

Under Mac OS X: 
   The dirent.h include file needs the stdlib.h include file.
   Run the convertmac program to modify the following files to
   include stdlib.h before dirent.h:
   shownames.c, printaccesstest.c, printaccessmodtest.c, printaccessmodbadtest.c


If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
