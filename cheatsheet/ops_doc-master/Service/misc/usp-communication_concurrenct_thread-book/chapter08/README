This file contains information about compiling the programs from Chapter 8
of UNIX Systems Programming.

Under Solaris: no changes needed.

Under Linux:
   Compiling the programs under Linux typically requires that the constant
   _GNU_SOURCE be defined.  Run the convertlinux program once to modify the
   makefile use this constant.

Under Mac OS X:
   Mac OS X does not support asynchronous I/O.  Run the convertmac program
   once to remove the programs that do asynchronous I/O from the default
   compilation.

If you run the programs on another system and need to make modifications to
make them work, please send email to authors@usp.cs.utsa.edu to let us know
what you did.
