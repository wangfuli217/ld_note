LSAN_OPTIONS environment variable.
flag 	        default 	description
exitcode 	    23 	        If non-zero, LSan will call _exit(exitcode) upon detecting leaks. This can be different from the exit code used to signal ASan errors.
max_leaks 	    0 	        If non-zero, report only this many top leaks.
suppressions 	(none) 	    Path to file containing suppression rules (see below)
print_suppressions 	1 	    If 1, print statistics for matched suppressions.
report_objects 	0 	        If 1, LSan will report the addresses of individual leaked objects.
use_unaligned 	0 	        If 0, LSan will only consider properly aligned 8-byte patterns when looking for pointers. Set to 1 to include unaligned patterns. This refers to the pointer itself, not the memory being pointed at.
