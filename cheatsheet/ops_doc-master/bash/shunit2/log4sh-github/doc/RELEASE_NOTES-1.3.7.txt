RELEASE NOTES FOR 1.3.7

by users.

NEW FEATURES

Added dash to the list of supported shells.

Logging to remote hosts via syslog now supported. This requires setting 'nc'
alternative command to point to nc (netcat) as the command is not present by
default on most systems.

The RollingFileAppender now works properly. Files are rotated based upon a
maximum file size, and the number of backup files can be limited with a maximum
backup index.


CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS

There seems to be slowly growing interest in log4sh, so the time has come to
start tracking some bugs more officially in the bug tracking of SourceForge.
The few bugs that were reported for this release have been entered into the
tracking system for the sake of posterity.

Additional unit tests:
+ testMultipleAppenders
+ testSyslogAppender


BUG FIXES

There were some small bugs reported by users with the SMTPAppender and
SyslogAppender that were fixed.

There were as well a tiny issue with the dash shell that required some source
rearrangement. The dash shell also did not like the dummy functions used in
shUnit, so they had to be slightly altered.

The subject was not being set properly in the SMTPAppender.

The pdksh shell now works properly.

Bug# 1611574 -- 'unbound variable' error

Bug# 1614338 -- SyslogAppender not logging


DEPRECATED FEATURES

The logger_pushThreadName() and logger_popThreadName() functions have been
deprecated. They are not part of the standard log4j, and their usefulness is
quite limited seeing as shell does not support threads.


KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

Passing of the '\' character in an logging message does not work under the
standard Solaris Bourne shell [/bin/sh], under the dash shell [/bin/dash], or
under Cygwin with ksh [/bin/ksh].

The DailyRollingFileAppender appender do not roll files.

Trap handling is not yet absolutely 100% fool-proof.

Performance is prohibitively slow under Cygwin

More error checking/reporting needs to be added; this includes validating input
to public functions.
