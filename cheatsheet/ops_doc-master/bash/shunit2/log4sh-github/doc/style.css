/*
   Style the HMTL <body> tag with a sans-serif font and 6% margin.
   A sans-serif font makes documents easier to read when displayed on
   a computer screen.  Whitespace surrounding the document should
   make it easier to read both on screen and on printed paper. The
   value of 6% was chosen because it closely approximates a one-half
   inch margin on a US letter (8.5" by 11") paper.  Since the margin
   is expressed as a percentage it should scale well in a web browser
   window.

   Style the programlisting and screen classes with a light gray
   background and a small bit of space between the object border and
   the text inside.  The programlisting and screen classes are HTML
