BUILD DOCUMENTATION

As log4sh is a shell script, there is no need to build the code.  It is already
built.  There is a Makefile included that simplifies various things about
environment setup, but nothing more.


BUILDING THE DOCBOOK DOCUMENTATION

To build the documentation, you will need the following installed on your
system:

o Sun Java JRE 1.3.x (or newer)
o Apache Ant 1.5 (or newer)
o bzip2
o tar
o unzip

The documentation is built using XML and XSLT from the DocBook project.  The
required files are not included in the log4sh distribution as they are not
normally needed.  The necessary archives can be retrieved from the one of the
URLs listed below.  Place the files in the share/dist directory.

docbook-xml-4.3.zip
  http://www.docbook.org/xml/4.3/docbook-xml-4.3.zip
  http://forestent.com/dist/docbook/docbook-xml-4.3.zip
docbook-xsl-1.67.2.tar.bz2
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/docbook/docbook-xsl-1.67.2.tar.bz2?download
  http://forestent.com/dist/docbook/docbook-xsl-1.67.2.tar.bz2

Once the archives have copied to the share/dist directory, they can be
extracted into the share/docbook directory.  There is a Makefile in that
directory that will automate this task.

$ cd share/docbook
$ make

Once the archives are extracted, it can be generated by running ant.  Change to
the src/docbook directory, and run ant.  The documentation will be generated in
the distributions doc directory.

$ cd src/docbook
$ ant
