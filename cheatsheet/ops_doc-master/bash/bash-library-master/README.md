To begin, have a look at [the wiki](http://github.com/piwi/bash-library/wiki).


Installation
------------

Installing the *Piwi Bash Library* is as simple as making a copy of two files in your target
directory: the **library source itself** and **its Unix manual page**.

You can install the package in many ways explained in the [Global documentation](http://github.com/piwi/bash-library/wiki) ;
the best practice is to use **the internal interface** as it presents facilities to update the library.

    wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/piwi/bash-library/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar -xvf master.tar.gz
    cd piwi-bash-library-master
    ./bin/piwi-bash-library help

To read the library's manpage, run:

    man man/piwi-bash-library.man

Usage
-----

To use the library in a bash script, just `source` it at the top of your code or before any
call of its methods or variables:

    #!/bin/bash
    source path/to/piwi-bash-library.bash
    ...

The full documentation of the library is available online at <http://github.com/piwi/bash-library/wiki>.


Demonstrations
--------------

A set of test and demonstration files is included in the `samples/` directory of the package.
These files are not required for a normal usage of the library.

To run one of these tests, just run:

    cd path/to/downloaded/package/piwi-bash-library
    ./samples/file-test.sh

You can use the `--help` option to get help or info:

    ./samples/file-test.sh --help
