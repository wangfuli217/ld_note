#inotifywait 3.14
#Wait for a particular event on a file or set of files.
#Usage: inotifywait [ options ] file1 [ file2 ] [ file3 ] [ ... ]
#Options:
#	-h|--help     	Show this help text.
#	@<file>       	Exclude the specified file from being watched.
#	--exclude <pattern>
#	              	Exclude all events on files matching the
#	              	extended regular expression <pattern>.
#	--excludei <pattern>
#	              	Like --exclude but case insensitive.
#	-m|--monitor  	Keep listening for events forever.  Without
#	              	this option, inotifywait will exit after one
#	              	event is received.
#	-d|--daemon   	Same as --monitor, except run in the background
#	              	logging events to a file specified by --outfile.
#	              	Implies --syslog.
#	-r|--recursive	Watch directories recursively.
#	--fromfile <file>
#	              	Read files to watch from <file> or `-' for stdin.
#	-o|--outfile <file>
#	              	Print events to <file> rather than stdout.
#	-s|--syslog   	Send errors to syslog rather than stderr.
#	-q|--quiet    	Print less (only print events).
#	-qq           	Print nothing (not even events).
#	--format <fmt>	Print using a specified printf-like format
#	              	string; read the man page for more details.
#	--timefmt <fmt>	strftime-compatible format string for use with
#	              	%T in --format string.
#	-c|--csv      	Print events in CSV format.
#	-t|--timeout <seconds>
#	              	When listening for a single event, time out after
#	              	waiting for an event for <seconds> seconds.
#	              	If <seconds> is 0, inotifywait will never time out.
#	-e|--event <event1> [ -e|--event <event2> ... ]
#		Listen for specific event(s).  If omitted, all events are
#		listened for.
#
#Exit status:
#	0  -  An event you asked to watch for was received.
#	1  -  An event you did not ask to watch for was received
#	      (usually delete_self or unmount), or some error occurred.
#	2  -  The --timeout option was given and no events occurred
#	      in the specified interval of time.
#
#Events:
#	access		file or directory contents were read
#	modify		file or directory contents were written
#	attrib		file or directory attributes changed
#	close_write	file or directory closed, after being opened in
#	           	writable mode
#	close_nowrite	file or directory closed, after being opened in
#	           	read-only mode
#	close		file or directory closed, regardless of read/write mode
#	open		file or directory opened
#	moved_to	file or directory moved to watched directory
#	moved_from	file or directory moved from watched directory
#	move		file or directory moved to or from watched directory
#	create		file or directory created within watched directory
#	delete		file or directory deleted within watched directory
#	delete_self	file or directory was deleted
#	unmount		file system containing file or directory unmounted
