1. 如果一个词以 S, X 或 Z 结尾，加 ES。如 “Bass” 变成 “basses”，“fax” 
变成 “faxes”，还有 “waltz” 变成 “waltzes”。
2. 如果一个词以发音的 H 结尾，加 ES；若以不发音的 H 结尾，加 S。什
么是发音的 H？和其他字母混合在一起发出一个你可以听到的声音。
那么，“coach” 变成 “coaches” ，“rash” 变成 “rashes”，因为在读出来时
你可以听到 CH 和 SH 的声音。但是，“cheetah” 变成 “cheetahs”，因为
H 不发音。
3. 如果一个词以发 I 音的 Y 结尾，把 Y 变成 IES；如果 Y 与元音搭配在一
起发出其他声音则只添加 S。因此，“vacancy” 变成 “vacancies”，但 
“day” 变成 “days”。
4. 如果一切规则都不适用，就只添加 S 并祈祷不会错。
