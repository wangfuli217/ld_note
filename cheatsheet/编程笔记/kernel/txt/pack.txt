All auxiliary stuff like patches, images, testing files are in respective dirs.
Under picd/, run `pdflatex picd_report.tex' for 2 times to compile out `picd_report.pdf'
Just press `Enter' meeting with ERRORS during compiling, it's ok.
As the ERRORS are lots of, my suggestion is keeping `Enter' down when compiling.


Update cyclesoak dnsmasq hotplug2 mtd uclibc++.
Drop php5, as offical WR has alrealy included it.

cyclesoak:
I discussed with Ms. Liang, I'll give the final patch for the latest bug in April or May.
The current patch may make it run on ARM multicore.

dnsmasq:
Ever I used Fedora14 as dhcp server, failed, this time I used Archlinux as server, succeeded.
Also for dhcp-static allocation.
Dns and tftp parts both support IPv6, what a shame I didn't succeed.
Maybe it's my config faults, especially for tftp functionality.

hotplug2:
The current Mindspeed-OpenWrt-SDK on our board used old version of base-files, which use hotplug2-0.9.
While OpenWrt has built new base-files infrastructure, which use hotplug2-1.0.
V1.0 must be patched with 8 offical ones.
After that it can load modules and download firmware automatically to make wireless card work.

mtd:
Seems can't support UBIFS, since UBIFS doesn't like YAFFS/JAFFS, working on UBI logic 
volumn rather than physical MTD. 
I asked the maintainer, no response yet.

uclibc++:
It hasn't supported wchar yet. So the last item of auto-tests will be skipped.

qosapp/qoscom:
So sorry for my disability, no substantive progress, so no new chapters.
My mentors have some other to deal now, haven't turned to qos.

igmpproxy:
No testing design, just find a start script /etc/init.d/igmpproxy from Internet, 
which isn't in offical tarball.
Some one find bugs and writes a simple tool to send/receive multicast UDP packages for testing.
I can't get it and want to try.


We can discuss, armx86@gmail.com
