/*
 * Semaphore Contention
 *
 * Write three simple modules where the second and third one use
 * a variable exported from the first one.  The second and third one
 * can be identical; just give them different names.

 * Hint: You can use the macro __stringify(KBUILD_MODNAME) to print
 * out the module name.

 * You can implement this by making small modifications to your
 * results from the modules exercise.

 * The exported variable should be a semaphore.  Have the first module
 * initialize it in the unlocked state.

 * The second (third) module should attempt to lock the semaphore, and
 * if it is locked, fail to load; make sure you return the appropriate
 * value from your initialization function.

 * Make sure you release the semaphore in your cleanup function.

 * Test by trying to load both modules simultaneously, and see if it is possible.
 * Make sure you can load one of the modules after the other has been unloaded, to
 * make sure you released the semaphore properly.
