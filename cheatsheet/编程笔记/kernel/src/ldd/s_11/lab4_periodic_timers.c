/*
 * Multiple Periodic Kernel Timers
 *
 * Write a module that launches two periodic kernel timer functions;
 * i.e., they should re-install themselves.
 *
 * One periodic sequence should be for less than 256 ticks (so it
 * falls in the tv1 vector), and the other should be for less than 16
 * K ticks (so it falls in the tv2 vector.)
 *
 * Each time the timer functions execute, print out the total elapsed
 * time since the module was loaded (in jiffies).
 *
 * For one of the functions, also read the TSC and calibrate with the
 * CPU frequency (as read from /proc/cpuinfo or the cpu_khz> variable)
 * to print out the elapsed time (hopefully) more accurately.
