/*
 * Deferred Functions (tasklet solution)
 *
 * Write a driver that schedules a deferred function whenever a
 * write() to the device takes place.
 *
 * Pass some data to the driver and have it print out.
 *
 * Have it print out the current->pid field when the tasklet is
 * scheduled, and then again when the queued function is executed.
 *
 * Implement this using:
 *
 * tasklets
 * work queues
 *
 * You can use the same testing programs you used in the sleep
 * exercises.
 *
 * Try scheduling multiple deferred functions
 * and see if they come out in LIFO or FIFO order.  What happens if you
 * try to schedule the deferred function more than once?
