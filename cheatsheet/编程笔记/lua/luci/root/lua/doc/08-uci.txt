The UCI system
Writing bash scripts using the /lib/config/uci.sh or the uci command line 
functions
-----------------------------------
Setting uci anonymously named sections
-----------------------------------

if you have a uci config that has sections with only section types and no 
stated name there is a special syntax for modifying them


config system
    list affects 'luci_statistics'
    option init 'avahi-daemon'

config system
    list affects 'luci_statistics'
    option init 'pineapple'

You can use the command line interface to modify only the first like this:

uci set ucitrack.@system[0].init=new-value

You can use the /lib/config/uci.sh scripts to do it like this

uci_set ucitrack @system[0] init new-value

You can access the last in one of two ways:

uci set ucitrack.@system[-1].init=new-value
uci set ucitrack.@system[1].init=new-value

[-1] will get the last section. [-2] will get the second from last, and etc.

You don't even have to specify the config type. uci set ucitrack.@[-1].init=
new-value


This will take the last section in the config file and modify it.
