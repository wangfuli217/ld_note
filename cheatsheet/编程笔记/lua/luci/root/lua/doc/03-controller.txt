The Index and Entry's

See: example & guide in example/empty_controller.lua & example/
guide_controller.lua

Making a controller
-----------------------------------	
module creation the index function


The Index Function
-----------------------------------	
The dispatcher calls the index function of a

Entries
The CBI Call
-----------------------------------	
While there are many attributes you can set for a cbi value within its object 
structure in the cbi file there are a few that can only be set in the call 
itself. These attributes are parsed by the dispatcher's _cbi function. You 
can pass a set of configurations to the cbi call by passing it a table as 
below.
cbi("path/to/cbi", {"config values"})

The Following config vallues are allowed:
-----------------------------------	
    on_success_to If set this will redirect to the node passed it upon a form 
value returning that it was valid, done, changed or skipped (see:cbi-form 
values)

    on_changed_to If set this will redirect to the node passed it upon a form 
value returning that it was changed or skipped (see:cbi-form values)

    on_valid_to If set this will redirect to the node passed it upon a form 
value returning that it was valid, or done (see:cbi-form values)

    noheader If set this will cause a CBI page to be rendered without the CBI 
header (which contains the start of the form that all CBI values are 
contained within) and without the OpenWRT Theme header.

    nofooter If set this will cause a CBI page to be rendered without the CBI 
footer (which contains the CBI submission buttons) and without the OpenWRT 
Theme footer.

    autoapply
    hideresetbtn Hide the reset button on the footer
    hideapplybtn Hide the apply button on the footer
    hidesavebtn hide the save button on the footer
    skip Add the skip button on the footer (really only useful if you are 
making a flow/deligator based config.)


Enabling / Disabling Authentication
-----------------------------------	
To enable authentication you need to set the sysauth properties on your root-
level node:

x = entry({"myApp"}, template("myApp/overview"), "myApp", 1)
x.dependant = false
x.sysauth = "root"
x.sysauth_authenticator = "htmlauth"

(see controller/admin/index.lua)

To make your site the index, use:
-----------------------------------	
local root = node()
root.target = alias("myApp")
root.index = true

This should work as long as the name of your app > "admin" due to 
alphabetical sorting.
