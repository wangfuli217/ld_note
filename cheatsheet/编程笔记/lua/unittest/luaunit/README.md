## LuaUnit
by Philippe Fremy

LuaUnit is a popular unit-testing framework for Lua, with an interface typical
of xUnit libraries (Python unittest, Junit, NUnit, ...). It supports 
several output formats (Text, TAP, JUnit, ...) to be used directly or work with Continuous Integration platforms
(Jenkins, Hudson, ...).

For simplicity, LuaUnit is contained into a single-file and has no external dependency. To start using it, 
just add the file *luaunit.lua* to your project. A [LuaRocks package](https://luarocks.org/modules/bluebird75/luaunit) is also available.

Tutorial and reference documentation is available on
[read-the-docs](http://luaunit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

LuaUnit may also be used as an assertion library, to validate assertions inside a running program. In addition, it provides
a pretty stringifier which converts any type into a nicely formatted string (including complex nested or recursive tables).

## More details

LuaUnit provides a wide range of assertions and goes into great efforts to provide the most useful output. For example
since version 3.3 , comparing lists will provide a detailed difference analysis:

	-- lua test code. Can you spot the difference ?
    function TestListCompare:test1()
        local A = { 121221, 122211, 121221, 122211, 121221, 122212, 121212, 122112, 122121, 121212, 122121 } 
        local B = { 121221, 122211, 121221, 122211, 121221, 122212, 121212, 122112, 121221, 121212, 122121 }
        lu.assertEquals( A, B )
    end

    $ lua test_some_lists_comparison.lua

    TestListCompare.test1 ... FAIL
	test/some_lists_comparisons.lua:22: expected: 

	List difference analysis:
	* lists A (actual) and B (expected) have the same size
	* lists A and B start differing at index 9
	* lists A and B are equal again from index 10
	* Common parts:
	  = A[1], B[1]: 121221
	  = A[2], B[2]: 122211
	  = A[3], B[3]: 121221
	  = A[4], B[4]: 122211
	  = A[5], B[5]: 121221
	  = A[6], B[6]: 122212
	  = A[7], B[7]: 121212
	  = A[8], B[8]: 122112
	* Differing parts:
	  - A[9]: 122121
	  + B[9]: 121221
	* Common parts at the end of the lists
	  = A[10], B[10]: 121212
	  = A[11], B[11]: 122121


The command-line options provide a flexible interface to select tests by name or patterns, control output
format, set verbosity and more. See [the documentation](http://luaunit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#command-line-options) .

LuaUnit also provides some dedicated support to scientific computing. See [the documentation](http://luaunit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#scientific-computing-and-luaunit) .

LuaUnit is very well tested: code coverage is 99.5% . The test suite is run on every version of Lua (Lua 5.1 to 5.3, LuaJIT 2.0 and 2.1 beta)
and on many OS (Windows Seven, Windows Server 2012, MacOs X and Ubuntu). You can check the continuous build results on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/bluebird75/luaunit) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bluebird75/luaunit).

LuaUnit is maintained on GitHub: https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit . We gladly accept feature requests and even better Pull Requests.
For more information on LuaUnit development, please check: [Developing LuaUnit](http://luaunit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#developing-luaunit) . 

LuaUnit is released under the BSD license.

## LuaUnit successes

Version 3.2 of LuaUnit has been downloaded more than 235 000 times on [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/bluebird75/luaunit)

LuaUnit is used in some very nice technological products. I like to mention:

* [SchedMD/Slurm](https://www.schedmd.com/): Slurm is an open-source cluster resource management and job scheduling 
system that strives to be simple, scalable, portable, fault-tolerant, and interconnect agnostic. On the June 2017 Top 500 computer 
list, Slurm was performing workload management on six of the ten most powerful computers in the world including the number 1 system, 
Sunway TaihuLight with 10,649,600 computing cores. LuaUnit is used by Slurm to validate plugins written in Lua. Thanks Douglas Jacobsen
to contribute back to LuaUnit. See the [GitHub repository of Slurm](https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm) .

* [MAD by the CERN](http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/): CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research, where physicists and engineers are 
probing the fundamental structure of the universe. MAD is one of the CERN project: MAD aims to be at the forefront of computational physics in 
the field of particle accelerator design and simulation. Its scripting language is de facto the standard to describe particle accelerators, simulate 
beam dynamics and optimize beam optics at CERN. Lua is the main language of MAD-ng, the new generatino of MAD. A fork of LuaUnit is used extensively 
for all MAD calculation and framework validation. Thanks Laurent Deniau for contributing back to LuaUnit. See the [GitHub repository of MAD](https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD) .

## Installation

**LuaRocks**

LuaUnit v3.3 is available on [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/bluebird75/luaunit). To install it, you need at least 
LuaRocks version 2.4.4 (due to old versions of wget being incompatible with GitHub https downloading)

**GitHub** 

The simplest way to install LuaUnit is to fetch the GitHub version:

    git clone git@github.com:bluebird75/luaunit.git

Then copy the file luaunit.lua into your project or the Lua libs directory.

The version in development on GitHub is always stable and can be used safely.

On Linux, you can also install it into your Lua directories

    sudo python doit.py install

If that fail, edit the function `install()` in the file `doit.py` to adjust
the Lua version and installation directory. It uses, by default, Linux paths that depend on the version.


### History 

#### Version 3.3 - 6. March 2018
* General
    * when comparing lists with assertEquals(), failure message provides an advanced comparison of the lists
    * assertErrorMsgEquals() can check for error raised as tables
    * tests may be finished early with fail(), failIf(), success() or successIf()
    * improve printing of recursive tables
    * improvements and fixes to JUnit and TAP output
    * stricter assertTrue() and assertFalse(): they only succeed with boolean values
    * add assertEvalToTrue() and assertEvalToFalse() with previous assertTrue()/assertFalse() behavior of coercing to boolean before asserting
        ** all assertion functions accept an optional extra message, to be printed along the failure
* New command-line arguments:
	* can now shuffle tests with --shuffle or -s
	* possibility to repeat tests (for example to trigger a JIT), with --repeat NUM or -r NUM
	* more flexible test selection with inclusion (--pattern / -p) or exclusion (--exclude / -x) or combination of both
* Scientific computing dedicated support (see documentation):
	* provide the machine epsilon in lu.EPS
	* new functions: assertNan(), assertInf(), assertPlusInf(), assertMinusInf(), assertPlusZero(), assertMinusZero()
	* in assertAlmostEquals( a, b, margin ), margin no longer provides a default value of 1E-11, the machine epsilon is used instead
* Platform and continuous integration support:
	* validate LuaUnit on MacOs platform (thank to Travis CI)
	* validate LuaUnit with 32 bits numbers (floats) and 64 bits numbers (double)
	* add test coverage measurements thank to coveralls.io . Status: 99.76% of the code is verified.
	* use cache for AppVeyor and Travis builds
	* support for luarocks doc command
* General doc improvements (detailed description of all output, more cross-linking between sections)

#### Version 3.2 - 12. Jul 2016
* distinguish between failures (failed assertion) and errors
* add command-line option to stop on first error or failure
* support for new versions: Lua 5.3 and LuaJIT (2.0, 2.1 beta)
* validation of all lua versions on Travis CI and AppVeyor
* added compatibility layer with forked luaunit v2.x
* added documentation about development process
* improved support for table containing keys of type table
* small bug fixes, several internal improvements

#### Version 3.1 - 10 Mar. 2015
* luaunit no longer pollutes global namespace, unless defining EXPORT_ASSERT_TO_GLOBALS to true
* fixes and validation of JUnit XML generation
* strip luaunit internal information from stacktrace
* general improvements of test results with duration and other details
* improve printing for tables, with an option to always print table id
* fix printing of recursive tables 

**Important note when upgrading to version 3.1** : assertions functions are
no longer exported directly to the global namespace. See documentation for upgrade
paths.

#### Version 3.0 - 9. Oct 2014

- first public release


#### Version 1.1
- move global variables to internal variables
- assertion order is configurable between expected/actual or actual/expected
