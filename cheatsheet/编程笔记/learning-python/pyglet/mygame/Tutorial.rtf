\f0\b\fs48 \cf0 Intro
\fs24 \
\
Why use Python for games?
\b0 \
The same reason you use Python for anything else. It's easy, it makes sense, and there are great libraries available.\
\

\b Speaking of libraries, what's available?
\b0 \
 * PyGame\
 * pyglet\
 * Panda3D\
\

\b Which one should I use?\

\b0 My personal opinion is that pyglet is the cleanest and fastest, but PyGame has also been used to do some cool things. Panda3D is more sophisticated, geared toward 3D, and has a much higher learning curve. I won't go into specifics for now.\
\
To get you familiar with pyglet, I'll walk you through the process of creating a simple version of the classic game Asteroids.\
\

\b\fs48 Part 1: Basic Graphics
\b0\fs24 \
\
The first version of our Asteroids clone will simply show a score of zero, a label showing the name of the program, three randomly placed asteroids, and the player's ship. Nothing will move.
\b\fs48 \

\fs36 \
Setting Up
\fs24 \
\
Installing Pyglet\

\b0 Download pyglet from http://pyglet.org/download.html and choose the distribution for your platform. The process is different for each platform, but simple on all of them, since pyglet has no external dependencies.
\b \
\
Setting Up the Files\

\b0 Since I wrote this example in stages, I'm putting the folder with the images, called 'resources,' outside the example folders. Each example folder contains a Python file called 
\f1\fs20 asteroid.py
\f0\fs24  which runs the game, as well as a 
\f1\fs20 game
\f0\fs24  module which contains most of the functionality. Your folder structure should look like this:\
\
mygame/\
	resources/\
		(images go here)\
	version1/\
		asteroids.py\
		game/\
			__init__.py
\b \
\
Getting a Window\

\b0 To set up a window, simply import pyglet, create a new instance of 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.window.Window
\f0\fs24 , and call 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.app.run()
\f0\fs24 .\
\

\f1\fs20 import pyglet\
game_window = pyglet.window.Window(800, 600)\
\
if __name__ == '__main__':\
	pyglet.app.run()
\f0\fs24 \
\
When you run the code above, you should see a window full of junk that goes away when you press Esc.\
\

\b Loading and Displaying an Image
\b0 \
Let's create a separate submodule of 
\f1\fs20 game
\f0\fs24  to hold resources, calling it 
\f1\fs20 resources.py
\f0\fs24 .\
\
Since our images reside in a directory other than the example's root directory, we need to tell pyglet where to find them:\
\

\f1\fs20 import pyglet\
pyglet.resource.path = ['../resources']\
pyglet.resource.reindex()\

\f0\fs24 \
The resource path starts with '../' because the 
\f1\fs20 resources
\f0\fs24  folder is on the same level as the 
\f1\fs20 version1
\f0\fs24  folder. If we left it off, pyglet would look inside 
\f1\fs20 version1
\f0\fs24  for the 
\f1\fs20 resources
\f0\fs24  folder.\
\
Now that pyglet's 
\f1\fs20 resource
\f0\fs24  module is initialized, we can easily load the images:\
\

\f1\fs20 player_image = pyglet.resource.image("player.png")\
bullet_image = pyglet.resource.image("bullet.png")\
asteroid_image = pyglet.resource.image("asteroid.png")\

\f0\fs24 \

\b Centering the Images
\b0 \
Pyglet will draw all images from their lower left corner by default. We don't want this behavior for our images, which need to rotate around their centers. All we have to do to fix this problem is set their anchor points:\
\

\f1\fs20 def center_image(image):\
    """Sets an image's anchor point to its center"""\
    image.anchor_x = image.width/2\
    image.anchor_y = image.height/2
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we can just call 
\f1\fs20 center_image()
\f0\fs24  on all our loaded images:\
\

\f1\fs20 center_image(player_image)\
center_image(bullet_image)\
center_image(asteroid_image)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Remember that the 
\f1\fs20 center_image()
\f0\fs24  function must be defined before it can be called at the module level. Also, note that zero degrees points directly to the right in pyglet, so the images are all drawn with their front pointing to the right.\
\
To access the images from 
\f1\fs20 asteroids.py
\f0\fs24 , we need to use something like 
\f1\fs20 from game import resources
\f0\fs24 , which we'll get into in the next section.
\b\fs48 \

\fs36 \
Initializing Objects
\b0\fs24 \
\
We want to put some labels at the top of the window to give the player some information about the score and the current level. Eventually, we will have a score display, the name of the level, and a row of icons representing the number of remaining lives.\
\

\b Making the Labels
\b0 \
To make a text label in pyglet, just initialize a 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.text.Label
\f0\fs24  object:\
\

\f1\fs20 score_label = pyglet.text.Label(text="Score: 0", x=10, y=575)\
level_label = pyglet.text.Label(text="My Amazing Game", \
                                x=400, y=575, anchor_x='center')
\f0\fs24 \
\
Notice that the second label is centered using the anchor_x attribute.\
\

\b Drawing the Labels
\b0 \
We want pyglet to call a custom function whenever the window is drawn. To make that happen, we need to either subclass 
\f1\fs20 Window
\f0\fs24  and override the 
\f1\fs20 on_draw()
\f0\fs24  function, or use the 
\f1\fs20 @Window.event
\f0\fs24  decorator on a function with the same name:\
\

\f1\fs20 @game_window.event\
def on_draw():\
	# draw things here\

\f0\fs24 \
The 
\f1\fs20 @game_window.event
\f0\fs24  decorator lets the Window instance know that 
\f1\fs20 on_draw()
\f0\fs24  is an event handler. The on_draw event is fired whenever - you guessed it - the window needs to be redrawn. Other events include on_mouse_press and on_key_press.\
\
Now we can fill the method with the functions necessary to draw our labels. Before we draw anything, we should clear the screen. After that, we can simply call each object's 
\f1\fs20 draw()
\f0\fs24  function.\
\

\f1\fs20 @game_window.event\
def on_draw():\
    game_window.clear()\
    \
    level_label.draw()\
    score_label.draw()
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now when you run 
\f1\fs20 asteroids.py
\f0\fs24 , you should get a window with a score of zero in the upper left corner and a centered label reading "Version 1: Static Graphics" at the top of the screen.\
\

\b Making the Player and Asteroid Sprites\

\b0 The player should be an instance or subclass of 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.sprite.Sprite
\f0\fs24 , like so:\
\

\f1\fs20 from game import resources\
...\
player_ship = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(img=resources.player_image, x=400, y=300)
\f0\fs24 \
\
To get the player to draw on the screen, add a line to 
\f1\fs20 on_draw()
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 @game_window.event\
def on_draw():\
    ...\
    player_ship.draw()
\f0\fs24 \
\
Loading the asteroids is a little more complicated, since we'll need to place more than one at random locations that don't immediately collide with the player. Let's put the loading code in a new 
\f1\fs20 game
\f0\fs24  submodule called 
\f1\fs20 load.py
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 import pyglet, random\
import resources\
\
def asteroids(num_asteroids):\
    asteroids = []\
    for i in range(num_asteroids):\
        asteroid_x = random.randint(0, 800)\
        asteroid_y = random.randint(0, 600)\
        new_asteroid = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(img=resources.asteroid_image, \
                                            x=asteroid_x, y=asteroid_y)\
        new_asteroid.rotation = random.randint(0, 360)\
        asteroids.append(new_asteroid)\
    return asteroids
\f0\fs24 \
\
All we are doing here is making a few new sprites with random positions. There's still a problem, though: an asteroid might randomly be placed exactly where the player is, causing immediate death. To fix this issue, we'll need to be able to tell how far away new asteroids are from the player. Here is a simple function to calculate that distance:\
\

\f1\fs20 import math\
...\
def distance(point_1=(0, 0), point_2=(0, 0)):\
    """Returns the distance between two points"""\
    return math.sqrt((point_1[0]-point_2[0])**2+(point_1[1]-point_2[1])**2)
\f0\fs24 \
\
To check new asteroids agains the player's position, we need to pass the player's position into the 
\f1\fs20 asteroids()
\f0\fs24  function and keep regenerating new coordinates until the asteroid is far enough away. Pyglet sprites keep track of their position both as a tuple (
\f1\fs20 Sprite.position
\f0\fs24 ) and as 
\f1\fs20 x
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 y
\f0\fs24  attributes (
\f1\fs20 Sprite.x
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 Sprite.y
\f0\fs24 ). To keep our code short, we'll just pass the position tuple into the function.\
\

\f1\fs20 def asteroids(num_asteroids, player_position):\
    asteroids = []\
    for i in range(num_asteroids):\
        asteroid_x, asteroid_y = player_position\
        while distance((asteroid_x, asteroid_y), player_position) < 100:\
            asteroid_x = random.randint(0, 800)\
            asteroid_y = random.randint(0, 600)\
        new_asteroid = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(img=resources.asteroid_image, \
                                            x=asteroid_x, y=asteroid_y)\
        new_asteroid.rotation = random.randint(0, 360)\
        asteroids.append(new_asteroid)\
    return asteroids
\f0\fs24 \
\
For each asteroid, it chooses random positions until it finds one away from the player, creates the sprite, and gives it a random rotation. Each asteroid is appended to a list, which is returned.\
\
Now you can load three asteroids like this:\
\

\f1\fs20 from game import resources, load\
...\
asteroids = load.asteroids(3, player_ship.position)
\f0\fs24 \
\
The 
\f1\fs20 asteroids
\f0\fs24  variable now contains a list of sprites. Drawing them on the screen is as simple as it was for the player's ship: just cal their 
\f1\fs20 draw()
\f0\fs24  methods.\
\

\f1\fs20 @game_window.event\
def on_draw():\
    ...\
    for asteroid in asteroids:\
        asteroid.draw()
\f0\fs24 \
\

\b\fs48 Part 2: Basic Motion
\fs24 \
\

\b0 In the second version of the example, we'll introduce a simpler, faster way to draw all of the game objects, as well as add row of icons indicating the number of lives left. We'll also write some code to make the player and the asteroids obey the laws of physics.
\b\fs48 \

\fs36 \
More Graphics
\fs24 \
\
Drawing with Batches\

\b0 Calling each object's draw() method manually can become cumbersome and tedious if there are many different kinds of objects. Graphics batches simplify drawing by letting you draw all your objects with a single function call. All you need to do is create a batch, pass it into each object you want to draw, and call the batch's 
\f1\fs20 draw()
\f0\fs24  method.\
\
To create a new batch, simply call 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.graphics.Batch()
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 main_batch = pyglet.graphics.Batch()
\f0\fs24 \
\
To make an object a member of a batch, just pass the batch into its constructor as the 
\f1\fs20 batch
\f0\fs24  keyword argument:\
\

\f1\fs20 score_label = pyglet.text.Label(text="Score: 0", x=10, y=575, batch=main_batch)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Add the 
\f1\fs20 batch
\f0\fs24  keyword argument to each graphical object created in 
\f1\fs20 asteroids.py
\f0\fs24 .\
\
To use the batch with the asteroid sprites, we'll need to pass the batch into the 
\f1\fs20 game.load.asteroid()
\f0\fs24  function, then just add it as a keyword argument to each new sprite:\
\

\f1\fs20 def asteroids(num_asteroids, player_position, batch=None):\
    ...\
    new_asteroid = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(img=resources.asteroid_image, \
                                            x=asteroid_x, y=asteroid_y,\
                                            batch=batch)\

\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs20 asteroids = load.asteroids(3, player_ship.position, main_batch)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now you can replace those five lines of 
\f1\fs20 draw()
\f0\fs24  calls with just one:\
\

\f1\fs20 main_batch.draw()
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now when you run 
\f1\fs20 asteroids.py
\f0\fs24 , it should look exactly the same.\
\

\b Displaying Little Ship Icons
\b0 \
To show how many lives the player has left, we'll need to draw a little row of icons in the upper right corner of the screen. Since we'll be making more than one using the same template, let's create a function called 
\f1\fs20 player_lives()
\f0\fs24  in the 
\f1\fs20 load
\f0\fs24  module to generate them.\
\
The icons should look the same as the player's ship. We could create a scaled version using an image editor, or we could just let pyglet do the scaling. I don't know about you, but I prefer the option that requires less work.\
\
The function for creating the icons is almost exactly the same as the one for creating asteroids. For each icon we just create a sprite, give it a position and scale, and append it to the return list.\
\

\f1\fs20 def player_lives(num_icons, batch=None):\
    player_lives = []\
    for i in range(num_icons):\
        new_sprite = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(img=resources.player_image, \
                                          x=785-i*30, y=585, \
                                          batch=batch)\
        new_sprite.scale = 0.5\
        player_lives.append(new_sprite)\
    return player_lives
\f0\fs24 \
\
The player icon is 50x50 pixels, so half that size will be 25x25. We want to put a little bit of space between each icon, so we create them at 30-pixel intervals starting from the right side of the screen and moving to the left. Note that like the 
\f1\fs20 asteroids()
\f0\fs24  function, 
\f1\fs20 player_lives()
\f0\fs24  takes a 
\f1\fs20 batch
\f0\fs24  argument. A 
\f1\fs20 None
\f0\fs24  value specifies no batch.\

\b\fs36 \
Making Things Move
\b0\fs24 \
\
The game would be pretty boring if nothing on the screen ever moved. To achieve motion, we'll need to write our own set of classes to handle frame-by-frame movement calculations. We'll also need to write a Player class to respond to keyboard input.\
\

\b Creating the Basic Motion Class\

\b0 Since every visible object is represented by at least one Sprite, we may as well make our basic motion class a subclass of 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.sprite.Sprite
\f0\fs24 . Another approach would be to have our class inherit from 
\f1\fs20 object
\f0\fs24  and have a 
\f1\fs20 sprite
\f0\fs24  attribute, but I find that simply subclassing 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24  provides more convenient notation.\
\
Create a new 
\f1\fs20 game
\f0\fs24  submodule called 
\f1\fs20 physicalobject.py
\f0\fs24  and declare a 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  class. The only new attributes we'll be adding will store the object's velocity, so the constructor will be simple.\
\

\f1\fs20 class PhysicalObject(pyglet.sprite.Sprite):\
    \
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        super(PhysicalObject, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\
        \
        self.velocity_x, self.velocity_y = 0.0, 0.0
\f0\fs24 \
\
Each object will need to be updated every frame, so let's write an 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method.\
\

\f1\fs20     def update(self, dt):\
        self.x += self.velocity_x * dt\
        self.y += self.velocity_y * dt
\f0\fs24 \
\
What's 
\f1\fs20 dt
\f0\fs24 ? It's the 
\b time step
\b0 . Game frames are not instantaneous, and they don't always take equal amounts of time. If you've ever tried to play a modern game on an old machine, you know that frame rates can jump all over the place. There are a number of ways to deal with this problem, the simplest one being to just multiply all time-sensitive operations by 
\f1\fs20 dt
\f0\fs24 .\
\
If we give objects a velocity and just let them go, they will fly off the screen before long. Since we're making a version of Asteroids, we would rather they just wrapped around the screen. Here is a simple function that accomplishes this goal:\
\

\f1\fs20     def check_bounds(self):\
        min_x = -self.image.width/2\
        min_y = -self.image.height/2\
        max_x = 800 + self.image.width/2\
        max_y = 600 + self.image.height/2\
        if self.x < min_x:\
            self.x = max_x\
        elif self.x > max_x:\
            self.x = min_x\
        if self.y < min_y:\
            self.y = max_y\
        elif self.y > max_y:\
            self.y = min_y
\f0\fs24 \
\
As you can see, it simply checks to see if objects are no longer visible on the screen, and if so, it moves them to the other side of the screen. To make every PhysicalObject use this behavior, add a call to 
\f1\fs20 self.check_bounds()
\f0\fs24  at the end of 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24 .\
\
To make the asteroids use our new motion code, just import the 
\f1\fs20 physicalobject
\f0\fs24  module and change the "new_asteroid = ..." line to create a new 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  instead of a 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24 . You'll also want to give them a random initial velocity. Here is the new, improved 
\f1\fs20 load.asteroids() function
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 def asteroids(num_asteroids, player_position, batch=None):\
    ...\
        new_asteroid = physicalobject.PhysicalObject(...)\
        new_asteroid.rotation = random.randint(0, 360)\
        new_asteroid.velocity_x = random.random()*40\
        new_asteroid.velocity_y = random.random()*40\
    ...
\f0\fs24 \
\

\b Writing the Game Update Function
\b0 \
To call each object's 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method every frame, we first need to have a list of those objects. For now, we can just declare it after setting up all the other objects:\
\

\f1\fs20 game_objects = [player_ship] + asteroids
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we can write a simple function to iterate over the list:\
\

\f1\fs20 def update(dt):\
    for obj in game_objects:\
        obj.update(dt)
\f0\fs24 \
\
The 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  function takes a 
\f1\fs20 dt
\f0\fs24  parameter because it is still not the source of the actual time step.\
\

\b Calling the Update Function
\b0 \
We need to update the objects at least once per frame. What's a frame? Well, most screens have a maximum refresh rate of 60 hertz. If we set our loop to run at exactly 60 hertz, though, the motion will look a little jerky because it won't match the screen exactly. Instead, we should have it update twice as fast, 120 times per second, to get smooth animation.\
\
Instead of using an actual loop to update the game every frame, we let pyglet call the function at a specified interval, using no more resources than are necessary. The 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.clock
\f0\fs24  module contains a number of ways to call functions periodically or at some specified time in the future. The one we want is 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.clock.schedule_interval()
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 pyglet.clock.schedule_interval(update, 1/120.0)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Putting this line above 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.app.run()
\f0\fs24  in the 
\f1\fs20 if __name__ == '__main__'
\f0\fs24  block tells pyglet to call 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  120 times per second. Pyglet will pass in the elapsed time, i.e. 
\f1\fs20 dt
\f0\fs24 , as the only parameter.\
\
Now when you run 
\f1\fs20 asteroids.py
\f0\fs24 , you should see your formerly static asteroids drifting serenely across the screen, reappearing on the other side when they slide off the edge.\
\

\b Writing the Player Class
\b0 \
In addition to obeying the basic laws of physics, the player object needs to respond to keyboard input. Start by creating a 
\f1\fs20 game.player
\f0\fs24  module, importing the appropriate modules, and subclassing 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 import physicalobject, resources\
\
class Player(physicalobject.PhysicalObject):\
    \
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        super(Player, self).__init__(img=resources.player_image, \
                                     *args, **kwargs)\

\f0\fs24 \
So far, the only difference between a 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  and a 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  is that a 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  will always have the same image. But 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  objects need a couple more attributes. Since the ship will always thrust with the same force in whatever direction it points, we'll need to define a constant for the magnitude of that force. We should also define a constant for the ship's rotation speed.\
\

\f1\fs20         self.thrust = 300.0\
        self.rotate_speed = 200.0
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we need to get the class to respond to user input. Pyglet uses a polling approach to input, sending key press and key release events to registered event handlers. We will need to constantly check if a key is down, and one way to accomplish that is to maintain a dictionary of keys. First, we need to initialize the dictionary in the constructor:\
        \

\f1\fs20         self.keys = dict(left=False, right=False, up=False)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Then we need to write two methods, 
\f1\fs20 on_key_press()
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 on_key_release()
\f0\fs24 . When pyglet checks a new event handler, it looks for these two methods, among others.\
\

\f1\fs20 import math\
from pyglet.window import key\
import physicalobject, resources\
...\
class Player(physicalobject.PhysicalObject)\
    ...\
    def on_key_press(self, symbol, modifiers):    \
        if symbol == key.UP:\
            self.keys['up'] = True\
        elif symbol == key.LEFT:\
            self.keys['left'] = True\
        elif symbol == key.RIGHT:\
            self.keys['right'] = True\
\
    def on_key_release(self, symbol, modifiers):\
        if symbol == key.UP:\
            self.keys['up'] = False\
        elif symbol == key.LEFT:\
            self.keys['left'] = False\
        elif symbol == key.RIGHT:\
            self.keys['right'] = False
\f0\fs24 \
\
That looks pretty cumbersome. There's a better way to do it which we'll see later, but for now, this version serves as a good demonstration of pyglet's event system.\
\
The last thing we need to do is write the 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method. It follows the same behavior as a 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  plus a little extra, so we'll need to call 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24 's 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method and then respond to input.\
\

\f1\fs20     def update(self, dt):\
        super(Player, self).update(dt)\
        \
        if self.keys['left']:\
            self.rotation -= self.rotate_speed * dt\
        if self.keys['right']:\
            self.rotation += self.rotate_speed * dt
\f0\fs24 \
\
Pretty simple so far. To rotate the player, we just add the rotation speed to the angle, multiplied by 
\f1\fs20 dt
\f0\fs24  to account for time. Note that 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24  objects' rotation attributes are in degrees, with clockwise as the positive direction. This means that you need to call 
\f1\fs20 math.degrees()
\f0\fs24  or 
\f1\fs20 math.radians()
\f0\fs24  and make the result negative whenever you use Python's built-in math functions with the 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24  class, since those functions use radians instead of degrees, and their positive direction is counter-clockwise. The code to make the ship thrust forward uses an example of such a conversion:\
\

\f1\fs20         if self.keys['up']:\
            angle_radians = -math.radians(self.rotation)\
            force_x = math.cos(angle_radians) * self.thrust * dt\
            force_y = math.sin(angle_radians) * self.thrust * dt\
            self.velocity_x += force_x\
            self.velocity_y += force_y
\f0\fs24 \
\
First, we convert the angle to radians so that 
\f1\fs20 math.cos()
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 math.sin()
\f0\fs24  will get the correct values. Then we apply some simple physics to modify the ship's X and Y velocity components and push the ship in the right direction.\
\
We now have a complete 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  class. If we add it to the game and tell pyglet that it's an event handler, we should be good to go.\
\

\b Integrating the Player Class\

\b0 The first thing we need to do is make 
\f1\fs20 player_ship
\f0\fs24  an instance of 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 from game import player\
...\
player_ship = player.Player(x=400, y=300, batch=main_batch)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we need to tell pyglet that 
\f1\fs20 player_ship
\f0\fs24  is an event handler. To do that, we need to push it onto the event stack with 
\f1\fs20 game_window.push_handlers()
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 game_window.push_handlers(player_ship)
\f0\fs24 \
\
That's it! Now you should be able to run the game and move the player with the arrow keys.\
\

\b\fs48 Part 3: Giving the Player Something to Do
\fs24 \
\

\b0 In any good game, there needs to be something working against the player. In the case of Asteroids, it's the threat of collision with, well, an asteroid. Collision detection requires a lot of infrastructure in the code, so this section will focus on making it work. We'll also clean up the player class and show some visual feedback for thrusting.
\b\fs48 \

\fs36 \
Simplifying Player Input
\fs24 \
\

\b0 Right now, the 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  class handles all of its own keyboard events. It spends 13 lines of code doing nothing but setting boolean values in a dictionary. One would think that there would be a better way, and there is: 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.window.key.KeyStateHandler
\f0\fs24 . This handy class automatically does what we have been doing manually: it tracks the state of every key on the keyboard.\
\
To start using it, we need to initialize it and push it onto the event stack instead of the 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  class. First, let's add it to 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24 's constructor:\
\

\f1\fs20         self.key_handler = key.KeyStateHandler()
\f0\fs24 \
\
We also need to push the 
\f1\fs20 key_handler
\f0\fs24  object onto the event stack. Keep pushing the 
\f1\fs20 player_ship
\f0\fs24  object in addition to its key handler, because we'll need it to keep handling key press and release events later.\
\

\f1\fs20 game_window.push_handlers(player_ship.key_handler)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Since 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  now relies on 
\f1\fs20 key_handler
\f0\fs24  to read the keyboard, we need to change the 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method to use it. The only changes are in the 
\f1\fs20 if
\f0\fs24  conditions:\
\

\f1\fs20         if self.key_handler[key.LEFT]:\
            ...\
        if self.key_handler[key.RIGHT]:\
            ...\
        \
        if self.key_handler[key.UP]:\
            ...
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we can remove the 
\f1\fs20 on_key_press()
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 on_key_release()
\f0\fs24  methods from the class. It's just that simple. If you need to see a list of key constants, you can check the API documentation under 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.window.key
\f0\fs24 .\
\

\b\fs36 Adding an Engine Flame
\fs24 \
\

\b0 Without visual feedback, it can be difficult to tell if the ship is actually thrusting forward or not, especially for an observer just watching someone else play the game. One way to provide visual feedback is to show an engine flame behind the player while the player is thrusting.\
\

\b Loading the Flame Image\

\b0 The player will now be made of two sprites. There's nothing preventing us from letting a 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24  own another 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24 , so we'll just give 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  an 
\f1\fs20 engine_sprite
\f0\fs24  attribute and update it every frame. For our purposes, this approach will be the simplest and most scalable.\
\
To make the flame draw in the correct position, we could either do some complicated math every frame, or we could just move the image's anchor point. First, load the image in 
\f1\fs20 resources.py
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 engine_image = pyglet.resource.image("engine_flame.png")
\f0\fs24 \
\
To get the flame to draw behind the player, we need to move the flame image's center of rotation to the right, past the end of the image. To do that, we just set its 
\f1\fs20 anchor_x
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 anchor_y
\f0\fs24  attributes:\
\

\f1\fs20 engine_image.anchor_x = engine_image.width * 1.5\
engine_image.anchor_y = engine_image.height / 2
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now the image is ready to be used by the player class. If you're still confused about anchor points, experiment with the values for 
\f1\fs20 engine_image
\f0\fs24 's anchor point when you finish this section.\
\

\b Creating and Drawing the Flame\

\b0 The engine sprite needs to be initialized with all the same arguments as 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24 , except that it needs a different image and must be initially invisible. The code for creating it belongs in 
\f1\fs20 Player.__init__()
\f0\fs24  and is very straightforward:\
\

\f1\fs20         self.engine_sprite = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(img=resources.engine_image, \
                                                  *args, **kwargs)\
        self.engine_sprite.visible = False
\f0\fs24 \
\
To make the engine sprite appear only while the player is thrusting, we need to add some logic to the if 
\f1\fs20 self.key_handler[key.UP]
\f0\fs24  block in the 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method.\
\

\f1\fs20         if self.key_handler[key.UP]:\
            ...\
            self.engine_sprite.visible = True\
        else:\
            self.engine_sprite.visible = False
\f0\fs24 \
\
To make the sprite appear at the player's position, we also need to update its position and rotation attributes:\
\

\f1\fs20         if self.key_handler[key.UP]:\
            ...\
            self.engine_sprite.rotation = self.rotation\
            self.engine_sprite.x = self.x\
            self.engine_sprite.y = self.y\
            self.engine_sprite.visible = True\
        else:\
            self.engine_sprite.visible = False
\f0\fs24 \
\

\b Cleaning Up After Death\

\b0 When the player is inevitably smashed to bits by an asteroid, he will disappear from the screen. However, simply removing the 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  instance from the 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24  list is not enough for it to be removed from the graphics batch. To do that, we need to call its 
\f1\fs20 delete()
\f0\fs24  method. Normally a 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24 's own 
\f1\fs20 delete()
\f0\fs24  method will work fine without modifications, but our subclass has its own 
\f1\fs20 Sprite
\f0\fs24  which must also be deleted when the 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  instance is deleted. To get both to die gracefully, we must write a simple 
\f1\fs20 delete()
\f0\fs24  method:\
\

\f1\fs20     def delete(self):\
        self.engine_sprite.delete()\
        super(Player, self).delete()
\f0\fs24 \
\
The 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  class is now cleaned up and ready to go.\
\

\b\fs36 Checking For Collisions
\fs24 \
\

\b0 To make objects disappear from the screen, we'll need to manipulate the 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24  list. Every object will need to check every other object's position against its own, and each object will have to decide whether or not it should be removed from the list. The game loop will then check for dead objects and remove them from the list.\
\

\b Checking All Object Pairs\

\b0 We need to check every object against every other object. The simplest method is to use nested loops. This method will be inefficient for a large number of objects*, but it will work for our purposes. We can use one easy optimization and avoid checking the same pair of objects twice. Here's the setup for the loops, which belongs in 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24 . It simply iterates over all object pairs without doing anything.\
\
* A better technique is spatial hashing, but if you reach the point where you need to use that, you should probably be using a C-based physics engine anyway.\
\

\f1\fs20     for i in xrange(len(game_objects)):\
        for j in xrange(i+1, len(game_objects)):\
            obj_1 = game_objects[i]\
            obj_2 = game_objects[j]
\f0\fs24 \
\
We'll need a way to check if an object has already been killed. We could go over to 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  right now and put it in, but let's keep working on the game loop and implement the method later. For now, we'll just assume that everything in 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24  has a 
\f1\fs20 dead
\f0\fs24  attribute which will be 
\f1\fs20 False
\f0\fs24  until the class sets it to 
\f1\fs20 True
\f0\fs24 , at which point it will be ignored and eventually removed from the list.\
\
To perform the actual check, we'll also need to call two more methods that don't exist yet. One method will determine if the two objects actually collide, and the other method will give each object an opportunity to respond to the collision. The checking code itself is easy to understand, so I won't bother you with further explanations:\
\

\f1\fs20             if not obj_1.dead and not obj_2.dead:\
                if obj_1.collides_with(obj_2):\
                    obj_1.handle_collision_with(obj_2)\
                    obj_2.handle_collision_with(obj_1)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now all that remains is for us to go through the list and remove dead objects:\
\

\f1\fs20     ...update game objects...\
    \
    for to_remove in [obj for obj in game_objects if obj.dead]:\
        to_remove.delete()\
        game_objects.remove(to_remove)
\f0\fs24 \
\
As you can see, it simply calls the object's 
\f1\fs20 delete()
\f0\fs24  method to remove it from any batches, then it removes it from the list. If you haven't used list comprehensions much, the above code might look like it's removing objects from the list while traversing it. Fortunately, the list comprehension is evaluated before the loop actually runs, so there should be no problems.\
\

\b Implementing the Collision Functions
\b0 \
We need to add three things to the 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  class: the 
\f1\fs20 dead
\f0\fs24  attribute, the 
\f1\fs20 collides_with()
\f0\fs24  method, and the 
\f1\fs20 handle_collision_with()
\f0\fs24  method. The 
\f1\fs20 collides_with()
\f0\fs24  method will need to use the 
\f1\fs20 distance()
\f0\fs24  function, so let's start by moving that function into its own submodule of 
\f1\fs20 game
\f0\fs24 , called 
\f1\fs20 util.py
\f0\fs24 :\
\

\f1\fs20 import pyglet, math\
\
def distance(point_1=(0, 0), point_2=(0, 0)):\
    return math.sqrt((point_1[0]-point_2[0])**2+(point_1[1]-point_2[1])**2)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Remember to call 
\f1\fs20 from util import distance
\f0\fs24  in 
\f1\fs20 load.py
\f0\fs24 . Now we can write 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject.collides_with()
\f0\fs24  without duplicating code.\
\
Some fancy-pants games use polygon-based or even pixel-perfect collision detection, but this ain't one of those high-falutin' triple-A games, so we'll just pretend everything is shaped like a circle with a radius of half the image width. Circle-to-circle collision detection is very simple: if the centers of the two objects are closer than 
\f1\fs20 radius_1 + radius_2
\f0\fs24 , then they are overlapping. Knowing this, we can write the 
\f1\fs20 collides_with()
\f0\fs24  method:\
\

\f1\fs20     def collides_with(self, other_object):\
        collision_distance = self.image.width/2 + other_object.image.width/2\
        actual_distance = util.distance(self.position, other_object.position)\
        \
        return (actual_distance <= collision_distance)
\f0\fs24 \
\
The collision handler function is even simpler, since for now we just want every object to die as soon as it touches another object:\
\

\f1\fs20     def handle_collision_with(self, other_object):\
        self.dead = True
\f0\fs24 \
\
One last thing: set 
\f1\fs20 self.dead = False
\f0\fs24  in 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject.__init__()
\f0\fs24 .\
\
And that's it! You should be able to zip around the screen, engine blazing away. If you hit something, both you and the thing you collided with should disappear from the screen. There's still no game, but we are clearly making progress.\
\

\b\fs48 Part 4: Collision Response
\fs24 \
\

\b0 In this section, we'll add bullets. This new feature will require us to start adding things to the 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24  list during the game, as well as have objects check each others' types to make a decision about whether or not they should die.\
\

\b\fs36 Adding Objects During Play
\fs24 \
\
How?\

\b0 We handled object removal with a boolean flag. Adding objects will be a little bit more complicated. For one thing, an object can't just say "Add me to the list!" It has to come from somewhere. For another thing, an object might want to add more than one other object at a time.\
\
There are a few ways to solve this problem. To avoid circular references, keep our constructors nice and short, and avoid adding extra modules, we'll have each object keep a list of new child objects to be added to 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24 .\
\

\b Tweaking the Game Loop\

\b0 The simplest way to check objects for children and add those children to the list is to add two lines of code to the 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24  loop. We haven't implemented the 
\f1\fs20 new_objects
\f0\fs24  attribute yet, but when we do, it will be a list of objects to add.\
\

\f1\fs20     for obj in game_objects:\
        obj.update(dt)\
        game_objects.extend(obj.new_objects)\
        obj.new_objects = []
\f0\fs24 \
\
Unfortunately, this simple solution is problematic. It's generally a bad idea to modify a list while iterating over it. The fix is to simply add new objects to a separate list, then add the objects in the separate list to 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24  after we have finished iterating over it.\
\
Declare a 
\f1\fs20 to_add
\f0\fs24  list just below the loop and add new objects to it instead. At the very bottom of 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24 , after the object removal code, add the objects in 
\f1\fs20 to_add
\f0\fs24  to 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24 .
\f1\fs20 \
    \
    ...collision...\
    \
    to_add = []\
    \
    for obj in game_objects:\
        obj.update(dt)\
        to_add.extend(obj.new_objects)\
        obj.new_objects = []\
    \
    ...removal...\
    \
    game_objects.extend(to_add)        
\f0\fs24 \
\

\b Putting the Attribute in PhysicalObject\

\b0 As mentioned before, all we have to do is declare a 
\f1\fs20 new_objects
\f0\fs24  attribute in the 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  class:\
\

\f1\fs20     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        ....\
        self.new_objects = []
\f0\fs24 \
\
To add a new object, all we have to do is put something in 
\f1\fs20 new_objects
\f0\fs24 , and the main loop will see it, add it to the 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24  list, and clear 
\f1\fs20 new_objects
\f0\fs24 .\

\b\fs36 \
Adding Bullets
\fs24 \
\
Writing the Bullet Class\

\b0 For the most part, bullets act like any other 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24 , but they have two differences, at least in this game: they only collide with some objects, and they disappear from the screen after a couple of seconds to prevent the player from flooding the screen with bullets.\
\
First, make a new submodule of 
\f1\fs20 game
\f0\fs24  called 
\f1\fs20 bullet.py
\f0\fs24  and start a simple subclass of 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24 .\
\

\f1\fs20 import pyglet\
import physicalobject, resources\
\
class Bullet(physicalobject.PhysicalObject):\
    """Bullets fired by the player"""\
    \
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        super(Bullet, self).__init__(resources.bullet_image, *args, **kwargs)
\f0\fs24 \
\
To get bullets to disappear after a time, we could keep track of our own 
\f1\fs20 age
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 lifespan
\f0\fs24  attributes, or we could let pyglet do all the work for us. I don't know about you, but I prefer the second option. First, we need to write a function to call at the end of a bullet's life:\
\

\f1\fs20     def die(self, dt):\
        self.dead = True
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we need to tell pyglet to call it after half a second or so. We can do this as soon as the object is initialized by adding a call to 
\f1\fs20 pyglet.clock.schedule_once()
\f0\fs24  to the constructor:\
\

\f1\fs20     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        super(Bullet, self).__init__(resources.bullet_image, *args, **kwargs)\
        pyglet.clock.schedule_once(self.die, 0.5)
\f0\fs24 \
\
There's still more work to be done on the 
\f1\fs20 Bullet
\f0\fs24  class, but before we do any more work on the class itself, let's get them on the screen.\
\

\b Firing Bullets\

\b0 The 
\f1\fs20 Player
\f0\fs24  class will be the only class that fires bullets, so let's open it up, import the 
\f1\fs20 bullet
\f0\fs24  module, and add a 
\f1\fs20 bullet_speed
\f0\fs24  attribute to its constructor:\
\

\f1\fs20 ...\
import bullet\
\
class Player(physicalobject.PhysicalObject):\
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        super(Player, self).__init__(img=resources.player_image, *args, **kwargs)\
        ....\
        self.bullet_speed = 700.0
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we can write the code to create a new bullet and send it hurling off into space. First, we need to resurrect the 
\f1\fs20 on_key_press()
\f0\fs24  event handler:\
\

\f1\fs20     def on_key_press(self, symbol, modifiers):\
        if symbol == key.SPACE:\
            self.fire()
\f0\fs24 \
\
The 
\f1\fs20 fire()
\f0\fs24  method itself will be a bit more complicated. Most of the calculations will be very similar to the ones for thrusting, but there will be some differences. We'll need to spawn the bullet out at the nose of the ship, not at its center. We'll also need to add the ship's existing velocity to the bullet's new velocity, or the bullets will end up going slower than the ship if the player gets going fast enough.\
\
As usual, convert to radians and reverse the direction:\
\

\f1\fs20     def fire(self):\
        angle_radians = -math.radians(self.rotation)\

\f0\fs24 \
Next, calculate the bullet's position and instantiate it:\
\

\f1\fs20         ship_radius = self.image.width/2\
        bullet_x = self.x + math.cos(angle_radians) * ship_radius\
        bullet_y = self.y + math.sin(angle_radians) * ship_radius\
        new_bullet = bullet.Bullet(bullet_x, bullet_y, batch=self.batch)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Set its velocity using almost the same equations:\
\

\f1\fs20         bullet_vx = self.velocity_x + math.cos(angle_radians) * self.bullet_speed\
        bullet_vy = self.velocity_y + math.sin(angle_radians) * self.bullet_speed\
        new_bullet.velocity_x, new_bullet.velocity_y = bullet_vx, bullet_vy
\f0\fs24 \
\
Finally, add it to the 
\f1\fs20 new_objects
\f0\fs24  list so that the main loop will pick it up and add it to 
\f1\fs20 game_objects
\f0\fs24 .\
\

\f1\fs20         self.new_objects.append(new_bullet)
\f0\fs24 \
\
At this point, you should be able to fire bullets out of the front of your ship. There's just one problem: as soon as you fire, your ship disappears. You may  have noticed earlier that asteroids also disappear when they touch each other. To fix this problem, we'll need to start customizing each class's 
\f1\fs20 handle_collision_with()
\f0\fs24  method.\
\

\b\fs36 Customizing Collision Behavior
\fs24 \
\

\b0 There are five kinds of collisions in the current version of the game: bullet-asteroid, bullet-player, asteroid-player, bullet-bullet, and asteroid-asteroid. There would be many more in a more complex game.\
\
In general, objects of the same type should not be destroyed when they collide, so we can generalize that behavior in 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24 . Other interactions will require a little more work.
\b \
\
Letting Twins Ignore Each Other\

\b0 To let two asteroids or two bullets pass each other by without a word of acknowledgement (or a dramatic explosion), we just need to check if their classes are equal in the 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject.handle_collision_with()
\f0\fs24  method:\
\

\f1\fs20     def handle_collision_with(self, other_object):\
        if other_object.__class__ == self.__class__:\
            self.dead = False\
        else:\
            self.dead = True
\f0\fs24 \
\

\b Customizing Bullet Collisions\

\b0 Since bullet collision behavior can vary so wildly across objects, let's add a 
\f1\fs20 reacts_to_bullets
\f0\fs24  attribute to 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObjects
\f0\fs24  which the 
\f1\fs20 Bullet
\f0\fs24  class can check to determine if it should register a collision or not. We should also add an 
\f1\fs20 is_bullet
\f0\fs24  attribute so we can check the collision properly from both objects.\
\
First, initialize the 
\f1\fs20 reacts_to_bullets
\f0\fs24  attribute to 
\f1\fs20 True
\f0\fs24  in the 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  constructor.\
\

\f1\fs20 class PhysicalObject(pyglet.sprite.Sprite):
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs20     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        ...\
        self.reacts_to_bullets = True\
        self.is_bullet = False\
        ...\
\
class Bullet(physicalobject.PhysicalObject):\
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        ...\
        self.is_bullet = True
\f0\fs24 \
\
Then, insert a bit of code in 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject.collides_with()
\f0\fs24  to ignore bullets under the right circumstances:\
\

\f1\fs20     def collides_with(self, other_object):\
        if not self.reacts_to_bullets and other_object.is_bullet:\
            return False\
        if self.is_bullet and not other_object.reacts_to_bullets:\
            return False\
        ...
\f0\fs24 \
\
Finally, set 
\f1\fs20 self.reacts_to_bullets = False
\f0\fs24  in 
\f1\fs20 Player.__init__()
\f0\fs24 . The 
\f1\fs20 Bullet
\f0\fs24  class is completely finished! Now let's make something happen when a bullet hits an asteroid.\
\

\b\fs36 Making Asteroids Explode
\fs24 \
\

\b0 Asteroids is challenging to players because every time you shoot an asteroid, it turns into more asteroids. We need to mimic that behavior if we want our game to be any fun. We've already done most of the hard parts. All that remains is to make another subclass of 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24  and write a custom 
\f1\fs20 handle_collision_with()
\f0\fs24  method, along with a couple of maintenance tweaks.\
\

\b Writing the Asteroid Class\

\b0 Create a new submodule of 
\f1\fs20 game
\f0\fs24  called 
\f1\fs20 asteroid.py
\f0\fs24 . Write the usual constructor to pass a specific image to the superclass, passing along any other parameters.\
\

\f1\fs20 import pyglet\
import resources, physicalobject\

\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs20 class Asteroid(physicalobject.PhysicalObject):\
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        super(Asteroid, self).__init__(resources.asteroid_image, *args, **kwargs)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we need to write a new 
\f1\fs20 handle_collision_with()
\f0\fs24  method. It should create a random number of new, smaller asteroids with random velocities. However, it should only do that if it's big enough. An asteroid should divide at most twice, and if we scale it down by half each time, then an asteroid should stop dividing when it's 1/4 the size of a new asteroid.\
\
We want to keep the old behavior of ignoring other asteroids, so start the method with a call to the superclass's method:\
\

\f1\fs20     def handle_collision_with(self, other_object):\
        super(Asteroid, self).handle_collision_with(other_object)
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we can say that if it's supposed to die, and it's big enough, then we should create two or three new asteroids with random rotations and velocities. We should add the old asteroid's velocity to the new ones to make it look like they come from the same object.\
\

\f1\fs20 import random\
...\
        if self.dead and self.scale > 0.25:\
            num_asteroids = random.randint(2, 3)\
            for i in xrange(num_asteroids):\
                new_asteroid = Asteroid(x=self.x, y=self.y, batch=self.batch)\
                new_asteroid.rotation = random.randint(0, 360)\
                new_asteroid.velocity_x = random.random()*70 + self.velocity_x\
                new_asteroid.velocity_y = random.random()*70 + self.velocity_y\
                new_asteroid.scale = self.scale * 0.5\
                self.new_objects.append(new_asteroid)
\f0\fs24 \
\
While we're here, let's add a small graphical touch to the asteroids by making them rotate a little. To do that, we'll add a 
\f1\fs20 rotate_speed
\f0\fs24  attribute and give it a random value. Then we'll write an 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method to apply that rotation every frame.\
\
Add the attribute in the constructor:\
\

\f1\fs20     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\
        super(Asteroid, self).__init__(resources.asteroid_image, *args, **kwargs)\
        self.rotate_speed = random.random() * 100.0 - 50.0
\f0\fs24 \
\
Then write the 
\f1\fs20 update()
\f0\fs24  method:\
\

\f1\fs20     def update(self, dt):\
        super(Asteroid, self).update(dt)\
        self.rotation += self.rotate_speed * dt
\f0\fs24 \
\
The last thing we need to do is go over to 
\f1\fs20 load.py
\f0\fs24  and have the 
\f1\fs20 asteroid()
\f0\fs24  method create a new 
\f1\fs20 Asteroid
\f0\fs24  instead of a 
\f1\fs20 PhysicalObject
\f0\fs24 .\
\

\f1\fs20 import asteroid\

\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs20 def asteroids(num_asteroids, player_position, batch=None):\
    ...\
    for i in range(num_asteroids):\
        ...\
        new_asteroid = asteroid.Asteroid(x=asteroid_x, y=asteroid_y, batch=batch)\
        ...\
    return asteroids
\f0\fs24 \
\
Now we're looking at something resembling a game. There are just a few more things left to do before we can pat ourselves on the back.\
